Failure of the propeller reduction drive unit  which resulted in drive belt and pulley failure and a subsequent loss of thrust requiring an emergency landing on soft terrain.  The reason for the bearing and/or belt failure was not determined.  A factor was the loss of propeller thrust, which precluded the pilot from maintaining the proper glide path to the runway.
