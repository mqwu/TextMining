The pilot not maintaining the proper airspeed during the circling approach, the inadvertent stall and the subsequent loss of control.  Factors were the pilot's decision to continue the approach in weather conditions below the approach/landing minimums, the continued flight below the minimum descent altitude, the pilot not following the approach airspeed listed in the owner's manual, the air traffic controllers not issuing weather information to the pilot, and the weather conditions.
