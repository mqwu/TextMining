The pilot's failure to maintain the proper airspeed (80 mph) on final approach resulting in a bounced landing and a  loss of control during an attempted go-around and ultimately the on ground collision with a residence.  Contributing factors were the pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the attempted go-around maneuver and the residence (structure).
