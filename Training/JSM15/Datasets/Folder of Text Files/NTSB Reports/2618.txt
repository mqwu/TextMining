The failure by the flight crew to abort the takeoff, as well as a failure by the flight instructor to properly monitor takeoff performance.  Contributing factors to the accident were the flight crew's failure to calculate required takeoff distance, considering existing density altitude and runway surface/condition, and to utilize all available runway length.
