The Extra 300L pilot's failure to maintain a visual lookout resulting in a midair collision while landing. Contributing to the accident was the Extra pilot's failure to follow written instructions contained in a NOTAM, and ATC instructions resulting in the Extra pilot making an approach to the wrong runway.
