The inadequate fuel consumtion calculations by the pilot resulting in fuel starvation during the aborted landing, and the overloaded steering link for undetermined reasons resulting in the lack of directional control during landing.  Factors were the electrical system failure for undetermined reasons, the visual approach slope indicator (VASI) system, and the altitude/clearance from the VASI not possible by the pilot.
