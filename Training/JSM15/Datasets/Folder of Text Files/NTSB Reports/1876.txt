The maneuver to avoid the utility wire while maneuvering resulting in an inadvertent stall and subsequent impact with the ground.  Factors were the pilot's inadvertent activation of the elevator trim, resulting in a loss of control during flight in instrument meteorological conditions, as a result of pilot's lack of knowledge concerning the operation of the autopilot system.  Another factor was the utility wire.
