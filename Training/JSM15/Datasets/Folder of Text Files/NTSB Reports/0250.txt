The total failure of the yoke weld assembly due to corrosion resulting in the inability of the flight crew to maintain elevator control of the airplane.  Additionally, inadequate annual inspection of the airplane by other maintenance personnel for failure to identfiy extensive corrosion of the yoke.  Findings in the investigation were: 1) The airplane was partially submerged in salt water as a result of hurricane Floyd in September 1999, 2) The Advisory Circulars do not identify inspection procedures what to do in case an airplane is sumberged or partially submerged in salt water, and 3) The airplane manufacturer does not have inspection procedures when an airplane is submerged or partially submerged in salt water.
