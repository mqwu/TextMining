The failure of the pilot to maintain clearance from the tree line.  Factors to the accident were the tailwind, the aircraft being near gross weight, the high density altitude, the rough runway condition, and the tree line.  An additional factor to the accident was the failure of the pilot to calculate takeoff performance data prior to the takeoff.
