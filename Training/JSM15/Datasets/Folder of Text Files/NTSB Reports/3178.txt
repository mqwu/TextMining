The pilot's inadequate visual lookout while lifting into a hover to ensure the helicopter was clear of all objects, which resulted in separation of an external mirror that then struck and damaged a main rotor blade.  Factors in the accident were the presence of a seismic cable, and high vegetation around the helicopter's takeoff spot.
