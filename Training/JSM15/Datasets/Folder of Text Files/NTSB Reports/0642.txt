the pilot's failure to ensure the aircraft's longitudinal axis was aligned with the runway prior to touchdown, and his failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll. Factors include landing with a tailwind, and the pilot's lack of recent experience in the particular make and model aircraft.  A factor in the severity of the post-accident fire was the kit manufacturer's inadequate  design, which allowed the excessive side-load failure of a main gear leg to pull a portion of the wall from a wing fuel tank.
