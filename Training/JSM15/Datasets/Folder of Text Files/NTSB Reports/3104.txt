The instructor's failure to maintain airspeed during climb after lift off from an aborted landing, resulting in the airplane stalling, entering a spin, and crashing into water at the departure end of the runway. Contributing to the accident was the instructor's improper monitoring of the dual student and the instructor's failure to abort an attempted go around when directional control was lost.
