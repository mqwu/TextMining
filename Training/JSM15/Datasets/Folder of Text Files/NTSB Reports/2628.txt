Inadequate visual lookout by both the accident pilot and the pilot of the other airplane.  An additional cause is the arrival procedure used which resulted in a congested traffic pattern and the subsequent inadequate visual separation of the airplanes.  Factors associated with the accident are the gusty crosswind, the pilot of the other aircraft landed longer than ATC expected, and the stall/spin encountered during the pilot's attempted remedial action.
