The pilot's improper in-flight decision to make a precautionary landing after sustaining a total loss of electrical power with sufficient fuel remaining to reach his destination airport. This resulted in an off field landing to an off site location in a remote area (open field) without landing lights and a subsequent on-ground collision with a berm on landing rollout. A factor to the accident was a failed voltage regulator.
