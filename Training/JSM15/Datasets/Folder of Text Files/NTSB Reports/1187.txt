The failure of the mechanic who installed the carburetor after overhaul to safety the throttle linkage at the carburetor per an Airworthiness Directive resulting in separation of the throttle linkage and subsequent partial loss of engine power.  Contributing to the accident was the unsuitable terrain encountered by the pilot-in-command during the forced landing.
