Aircraft control not being maintained by the pilot.  Contributing factors to the accident were the pilot maneuvering at a low airspeed, the encountered stall/spin, and the recovery from the spin at a low altitude, which resulted in altitude/clearance not being maintained from the trees.  Additional factors to the accident were the low fuel quantity, which resulted in fuel starvation and the momentary loss of engine power.
