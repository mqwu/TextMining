The pilot's failure to extend the spoilers during landing approach, which resulted in a touchdown at a higher than normal airspeed.  An additional cause was the intentional ground loop/swerve maneuver performed by the pilot to avoid overrunning the end of the runway.  Factors to the accident were the landing checklist not being performed by the pilot and the excessive airspeed encountered during the landing.
