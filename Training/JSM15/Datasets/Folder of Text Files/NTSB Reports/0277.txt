Rupture of the fuel injection flow divider diaphragm due to improper manufacture of the raw material stock from which the diaphragm was fabricated.  The diaphragm tear resulted in complete engine power loss, which required the pilot to descend into an undercast.  The undercast obscured the mountain, which the airplane impacted.  A factor in the accident was the manufacturer's inadequate quality control.
