The failure of the flight crew of the other airplane to maintain clearance while taxiing.  Factors contributing to the accident were heavy snow showers, snow-covered terrain, and the MD-82 ground-marshaling personnel's failure to follow procedures/directives when they did not display an emergency stop signal to the flight crew of the other airplane.
