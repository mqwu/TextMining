The MD-11 flight crew's failure to maintain adequate clearance while taxiing.  Factors contributing to the accident were heavy snow showers, snow-covered terrain, and the other airplane's (MD-82) ground-marshaling personnel's failure to follow procedures/directives when they did not display an emergency stop signal to the crew of the MD-11.
