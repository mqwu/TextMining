the pilot's failure to maintain obstacle clearance with the tower guy wire while the airplane was in cruise flight.  A contributing factor was the pilot's failure to update his navigation chart with the location of the tower during his preflight planning/preparation.  In addition, a contributing factor was the pilot's intentional flight of the airplane at a low altitude.
