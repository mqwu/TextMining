The proper touchdown point exceeded, all of the available runway not used, and aircraft control not being maintained by the pilot during the landing.  Factors to the accident were the pilot mistaking the taxiway for the runway, the pilot not performing a go-around after identifying the runway on final approach, and the ditch.
