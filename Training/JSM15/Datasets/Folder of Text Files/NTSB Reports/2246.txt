The pilot's failure to detect an unsafe boat wake during the landing process, and his inadvertent initiation of a porpoise after coming  in contact with the boat wake just after touchdown on a body of water.  Factors include a large wake wave/swell created by the movement of a boat in the area where the pilot chose to land.
