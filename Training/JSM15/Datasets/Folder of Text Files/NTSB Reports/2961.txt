The pilot's failure to perform a go-around once it became evident that his remedial action was not adequate to overcome the porpoise/pilot-induced oscillation that occurred during the landing flare. Factors include the pilot's inadvertent repeated ballooning/porpoising during the landing sequence, and a fence and line of trees off the departure end of the runway.
