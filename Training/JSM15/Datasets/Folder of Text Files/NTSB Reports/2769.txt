the pilot's inadequate preflight preparation, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a subsequent loss of engine power, and his failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the forced landing, which resulted in an inadvertent stall/mush.  Factors included the changing wind conditions, the high density altitude, and the lack of suitable terrain for a forced landing.
