The failure of the first officer to fly a stabilized approach at the correct airspeed and his failure to execute a missed approach resulting in touchdown about 5,000 feet past the runway threshold at an excessive airspeed and over run of the runway prior to stopping. Contributing to the incident was the failure of the captain to properly supervise the first officer and take corrective action.
