The private pilot/student's inadequate compensation for crosswind conditions and subsequent loss of directional control of the airplane during a touch and go, and the instructor pilot's inadequate supervision of the flight.  Factors in the accident were a crosswind, and the student's lack of total experience in the airplane.
