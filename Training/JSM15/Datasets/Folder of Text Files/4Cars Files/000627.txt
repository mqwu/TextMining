WOW. I had no idea there are so many other owners out here with defective trannies. I will NEVER buy another CarZZ again. My transmission crapped out on me when I was on a busy street during rush hour!!!! Stranded for 40 minutes until the tow truck arrived. 9000 miles on my TLS. It's been a love hate relationship with car when I owned it. Amazing engine but too many other problems. Rattles and squeaks EVERYWHERE thin paint cheap interior ....and of course the transmission. In all fairness though the transmission while it lasted was awesome. But whats the point if you're paranoid everytime you're behind the wheel. Not knowing when the trannies going to suddenly upshift. Some owner's expereinces are downright nightmarish shifting into second gear on the freeway at 80 mph. Holy cow. This is a mega lawsuit waiting to happen. Its only a matter of time.
