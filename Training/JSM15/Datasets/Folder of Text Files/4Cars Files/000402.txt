I love this car its nice and very quiet! I think that this is why little has changed in years about lexus...besides being more and more attractive. Althought dealership prices can empty your bank accounts but why go for the 100 dollar oil change! (its the same oil) go to toyota and get it from there....only do major servicing from lexus...thats WORTH IT!.... happy cruzin'
