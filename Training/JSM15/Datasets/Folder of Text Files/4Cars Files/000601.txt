Warning: I only took this for a test drive for about 30 min. Not what I'd consider a good review but a good first impression.    At a base price of 33000 Cdn it's a good price for a Benz. I tested the loaded version with the sport package leather seats and panorama sun roof. To get the fully loaded version you need another 10 grand or so. A cheap Benz is still a cheap Benz but there is no goodies. Big let down.    The car handles very nicely. Smooth ride even though they said the 17" wheels would provide a rougher ride compared to the standard 16" tires. Acceleration was beautiful. 0-100Kph in about 8 seconds.    The ride was very comfortable and the car is fun to drive. The car is hard to look out of the back but that's to be expected of a liftback. The added window at the bottom of the main rear window is useless. It is only used when your body is turned around to reverse and the window has an odd shape that distorts the image you see. You must get used to it.    While the problems with the car are there they are just cosmetic problems. I still daydream of driving that car everywhere.
