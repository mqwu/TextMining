This car is great! Its about 15 yrs old and has 178K miles on it but still running perfect. Just put in gas and drive the car and every 3000 mile change the oil thats it. Im really happy. I had this car since junior year in high school now im a sophmore in college and I plan to keep it until i graduate.
