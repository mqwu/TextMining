There is a lot to like with the Lexus ES300. Unfortunately the amount of tire/suspension noise I have experienced and the squeaks/ratZes have ruined the new car experience for me. I would not be happy with the same amount of tire/suspension noise and ratZes/squeaks in any new car particularly a car in the mid $30K's range. If you drive on all relatively smooth roads you will probably love the ES300. If you commute on choppy or bumpy roads test drive the ES300 on these roads before you buy. All the roads near the dealer I purchased my car from were in fine shape. If I had test driven the car on the roads I use I never would have purchased the ES300. I did use a 99 ES300 loaner car when my car was in for service. The loaner car's ride (on the same roads) was smoother the amount of tire/suspension noise less and the handling better than my 2000 Platinum Series. I have not had the opportunity to drive another Platinum Series on the same roads. Therefore I do not know if my experience is unique to my car or if I would have the same experience with any 2000 Platinum Series. Bottom line - test drive on the roads you normally use not the normal test drive route.
