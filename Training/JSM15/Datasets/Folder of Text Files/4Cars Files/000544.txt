there are two types of cars: Mercedes and others. what is so special about mercedes wannabe lexus? it's just a factory upgraded toyota with a 20k extra price tag. they just copy Mercedes design and instead of spending money and energy in that field they make them more reliable but not rebuildable. you can still see 1960s '70s mercedes cars around but who thinks they'll see 30-40 year old lexus cars? none.
