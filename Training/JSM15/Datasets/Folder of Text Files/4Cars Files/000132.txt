I bought the car for comfort during my 2 hours of commute every day. If you HAVE to commute it is so nice to sit in highway traffic isolated from outside noise in a comfortable easy-to-adjust seat which can be heated for your aching back listening to music! I find myself a lot less stressed when I get to work or get home.
