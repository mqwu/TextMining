i love it everything from the sporty luxury look to everything else when i first bought the car i felt it lack power from the 2.3 liter engine so i bought a couple of products from renntech n brabus. i didntttttt know i was capable of doin 540+hp with nitrous. i happen to be a undercover racer which means i hook up the engine and nothing more. i still have the same look as any person who own this model but my engine is totally diffrent. for any of those who feel this car is weak i have one thing to say "its not what kind of car u have it's what u do to it and how u drive it"
