I think this car is the best option that combines a sporty look with a sporty yet luxurious ride. With the optional spoiler it looks like a sports car. Inside it drives like a sporty luxury car. I'm 6'4" and I am comfortable in the driver's seat. Enjoy using the navigation system. Love the stereo. Back seat is roomy enough for 2 adults. I really like this car.
