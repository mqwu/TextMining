The hardtop is a great idea and works very well. All in all it's a well styled car. The rear end is not very fluid but it needs to appear stubby to house the hardtop. The 3.2 liter 6 is fairly powerful. It's also ideal for freeway driving. I wouldn't recommend purchasing the weak whiny 4 cylinder. It'll give you a headache at 60mph. This is not a sportscar. The handling and driving feel of the car are both subpar. The build quality is not good. Mercedes chose to make the car affordable and use low grade interior plastics. The squeaks and rattles are very annoying. At 30k this car makes some sense. However the build quality and subpar handling do not warrant the 50k+ price tag.
