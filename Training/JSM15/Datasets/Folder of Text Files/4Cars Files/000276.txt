An enjoyable drive. The Sport package with full leather sport suspension carbon fibre interior and 6-spoke rims is understated cool.  This car is very quiet and smooth riding at high speeds handles well and gets 37 mpg. The 200 ft lbs of torque really moves this Civic-sized car.  I think this car will appeal to those who want a safe quiet well-built prestigious yet understated near luxury sedan. Compared to the 2001 model the C230 has more horsepower and torque better fuel economy and better performance figures than the new C240.
