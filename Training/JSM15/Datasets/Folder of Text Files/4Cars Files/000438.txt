Best car I've ever owned by far. Four door sports car very solid feeling handling is a great compromise between performance and ride comfort. No real complaints other than some of the dealers. Also has held up well in resale market. Makes me want to go on errands. It has gotten a bit expensive over the past couple of years however.
