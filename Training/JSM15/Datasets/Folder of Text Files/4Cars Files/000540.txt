I must admit that the prestige of driving a M-B blinded me to some of the shortcomings of the C class. Although it's not the worst car I've ever driven it's far from the best. I drive my wife's CarZZ every chance I get! The car is very small and the 4 cylinder is rough and crude. I look forward to my lease being up in another year and will probably buy a Japanese car like a Lexus or an CarZZ. You can't beat them for the money. The M-B was not as good as the Volvo 960 I had just before it which cost about the same. I have not had the mechanical problems with my car that I read in other reviews on this page but it makes me nervious. I hope my car makes it in good shape for another year.
