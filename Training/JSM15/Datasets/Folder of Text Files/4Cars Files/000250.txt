Solid quality handsome elegant responsive car. This is my fifth big CarZZ having owned a 1987 5-speed and leased a 1988 1991 and 1995(twice)Legend; also my wife has leased three Integras. I hesitated to lease an RL after the Legends thinking the RL was too big and expensive by comparison; nowespecially after looking at the competition I'm happy with the upgrade to RL. We have always felt that we had among the very best cars on the road and never felt that we had to pay too much for them. I always smile when I get into this car and have received many compliments about its fine appearance. The car loves the open road and does fine around town as well.
