We took deliver on our 2001 530i in Apr. 2001. Purchase price was out the door w/ext. warranty. We purchased every option available on this vehicle with the exception of the comfort seats (didnttttt't need the leg extension feature). This luxury car is truly a lot of "F" "U" "N" to drive. My husband loves the Steptronic shifting and often gives me a neck-ache because of the vehicles torque and quick acceleration. The GPS was a nice-to-have but we do not utilize it but 3-4 times a year. Sure wish we could have used the $2k somewhere else. The upgraded stereo w/DSP is a must. We enjoy listening to music while driving not driving while listening to music.
