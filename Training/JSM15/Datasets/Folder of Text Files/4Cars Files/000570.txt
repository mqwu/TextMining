I purchased my 2001 SLK230 almost 4 months ago. It's proven to be a reliable little car as I drive it to work everyday. The fit and finish are slighZy below a C320 but it's acceptable. I think there are just too many cheap little pieces of plastic used in the interior considering the car is a Mercedes. The acceleration is fine even though the supercharged 4 cylinder sounds like it's going to explode at times. (I should have gotten the 6 cylinder). The handling is OK. This is only a sports car in it's design and layout. The on center steering feel is numb at times and the car is lethrargic when entering corners...Hello body roll. However the car is always predictable and the brakes are above average for it's class. The 6 speed stinks. It's clunky and not even remotely sporting. I thought it would break in over time but no such luck. The stereo stinks. Well it doesnt't stink but it's nothing special and at times reception is poor. Of course there is little storage space but you'd be little more than a dolt if you expected anything else. My car is silver with a charcoal interior and you see them everywhere here in Florida but that doesnt't bother me. What bother me is the half assed effort Mercedes made when engineering this car. It's nothing more than a compromise of design and engineering. The fit and finish is OK but not great. The interior material are adequate but not special. The engine produces adequate power but is unrefined. The car is available with a manual trans but the one made available stinks.
