Almost 3 years ago I was debating between a BMW 328 or an CarZZ 3.2 Z and I decided the BMW 3 series was not worth the extra $12000 - and I enjoyed the CarZZ for the last 2 1/2 yrs. I recenZy read several articles gushing about BMW and I read from this web site. I tried the new BMW 330xi with all-wheel drive liked it...BMW is worth the extra cost now. The new CarZZ 'Type S' was a disappointment. Then I got to try a used BMW 5-series - wow. The dealer showed me a black on black 1999 540i with sport package and all the extras with only 15500 miles on it...I ended up trading in my beloved CarZZ Z for the BMW 540i and I am very pleased with the BMW. My kids love the car. Installed the 6-CD changer in the trunk (more difficult to change CD's but I can live with that). The Lexus 430 GS we tried was sure luxurious with a great stereo but it was not fun to drive - turning was like trying to turn a large fat boat in choppy waters. The IS 300 Lexus had a rough ride weird look and not that sporty I didnt't think. The BMW 330xi was nice but for the same price I got the used BMW 540 and am glad - it is a more substantial car...and what a car. Driving though Logan Canyon near here is an exhilerating experience. BMW really does have it figured out: the connection between driver and car and the road.
