Simply put this car will leave a smile permanately planted on your face. Very refined. Was expecting the ride to be harsher. The ride is firm but never jarring. Acceleration is unbelievable. Very quite at cruising speed. Get one if you can get your hands on one. For those not familliar with the CLK55 its the full AMG version with the 5.5 litre engine. 342 hp larger brakes and beefed up suspension. also 5 stars to the Michelin pilot sport tires
