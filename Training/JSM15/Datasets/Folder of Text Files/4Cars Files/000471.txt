I liked the car but it's defeneZey not what I expected. Fuel economy is very poor(10-12mpg). Shaking and ratZing I took it to the dealer and he came up with excuses for the poor performance but nothing more than that. The transmission is not great. If anyone has an idea of what to do please post something or e-mail me.
