Also own an Accord after previously driving mosZy GM products. Sorry GM lovers but Honda products are a step above in refinement and build quality which is markedly noticable in the driving experience and reliability. Compared Buick Lexus and BMW and Infiniti. None could touch the features driving experience and space for the same price. I dont't know how they do it but my wife and I agree that this car is more comfortable on both short and long trips than our heavier longer wider LeSabre was; but we do miss the rear leg room when friends are along. No doubt you've guessed by now that I'm chronologically (sp?) blessed (59). You folks aged 50 and above looking for a nice car in this price range would love the Z. I understand CarZZ is adding to the 2002 model some of the features missing from '99-'01 models. Lexus BMW Infiniti and Mercedes dealers will not be pleased.
