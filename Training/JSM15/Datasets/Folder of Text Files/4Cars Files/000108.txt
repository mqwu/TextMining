This is probably one of the best cars that I have ever owned and for the money it is the best car I have ever owned! The dealer suggested factory authorized Comptech parts; headers cold air injection tighter springs anti-sway bars monster exhaust. The car is ridiculous. No one can believe how much car I got for so little money. The other day I blew the doors off a Mercedes CLK the guy couldn't get over it. The car handles well and did I say fast? The interior is fine and I am going to install the upgraded wood grain steering wheel and dash trim kit to add some interest. The dealer was great and I just bought my wife a new MDX from them. No bugs. No punch list. Even my Porsches had a laundry list of bugs for the dealer to fix. This car is highly recommended.
