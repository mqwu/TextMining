Great car! This car is fun to drive with few weaknesses. It's probably the best value for the $. I spent a year driving and reading about the competition and it's tough to find a car that gives what the Z-S gives for close to the same money.    I find the stereo ok not like most of the other reviewers but I guess it's all relative.
