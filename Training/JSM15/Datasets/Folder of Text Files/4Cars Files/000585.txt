This is a very satisfying car that I use when my larger SUV is not needed for people stuff or long crowded commutes. Comfortable powerful enough great engine sound. I love convertbles but hate a plastic window or cloth top - this car solves that problem and looks great in the process. Have not had any interior problems - I think the charcoal is less problematic than colored interiors that can scratch. Drivetrain on this car is rock solid - quick smooth and the AT shifts perfectly quickly and invisibly. Handling and roadholding is superb but the steering feel is not as satisfying as the Porsche - however this car has a better top and will require far fewer trips to the dealer. I have had no problems whatsoever with this car. Great daily driver because of MBZ durability - like other roadsters - if you're not on a crowded freeway commute and have lots of opportunities for the joys of open air motoring. If you dont't truly love the styling the top and the strength of this car you're missing the point. You need to drive it and compare with other cars you might consider. Its not for everyone but those who like them really do feel strongly about the SLK. My only regret is that the SLK32 was not available when I bought this car. If you are looking for a perfect - (perhaps more perfect than average new after reading some of these reviews!) - near new 2001 320 - send me an E-mail. I will seriously consider an upgrade to the quicker SLK32 if I can avoid getting nailed with the dealer trade in hit on such a new car.
