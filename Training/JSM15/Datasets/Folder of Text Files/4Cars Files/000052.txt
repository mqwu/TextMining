I had no idea what this car was when I leased it from a dealer in L.A. I was looking for a Benz and this one was in the paper. It took about 10 minutes of driving before I knew I HAD to have this beast. The only car ever Co-Built by Mercedes and Porsche it was only after it was mine that I started doing research and discovered what a special car I had on my hands. This car is flat out scary fast but it is stealthy so I have yet to get a ticket. It can be driven quite tamely...even my wife likes driving it...but god help the unsuspecting boy racers since this beast will stomp them at the line. The only thing that has ever been able to keep up is a newer E-55 a newer C-55 Vette and a pretty serious Porsche. It came from the factory loaded to the gills so no additions have been necessary. The are only two problems with the car.... It gets 18 MPG if you cruise...slowly and I have seen as low as 12 when I hammer it. It also has perhaps the worst headlights I've ever seen. I understand all the E-class cars of this era have the same problem. I literally almost ran off the road once because I literally couldn't see the curve coming up! It also eats tires...over 350 ft lbs of torque will tend to do that not really a problem just the price to pay for so much raw horsepower. I can't decide if I am going to keep it once the lease is up...what with fuel at nearly 2.40/gallon for premium in my area...but gawds is this car fun!
