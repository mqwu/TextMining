This is my 4th BMW first 5 series and is definately the best car I've owed period! Style performance comfort...this car has it all. Make no mistake this is a "Drivers car" i.e. Performance car first and a Luxury car second. If you are looking for straight Luxury car or the "Detroit Float" look elsewhere. Bought the car used about two years ago lease turn in with 28k on the clock now has just over 53k no major problems to speak of. Local dealer Hendrick BMW Charlotte NC has been outstanding ( supplied me with loaner cars even though they know I didnt't buy the car from them ). For non-warranty & performance work I use Bavarian Auto Service Rock Hill SC great service and a whole lot cheaper. Being a "spirited driver" and having a bad back I needed a car that I would enjoy "driving" but still give me some needed comfort the 528i fits the bill. This car has the Premium Package (Power everything) with the standard seats (heated) and while I would have preferred the "BMW Comfort seats" these are just fine. Car is quiet and stable at speed nimble and gets 28 mpg with the air on! To improve the overall performance I've donte a few minor ($650 total) mods that have made a major difference in the car. 1. installed a CAI (ECIS) w/K&N filter 2. installed "Conforti Shark Injector" engine mangement program Coupled together I have much better acceleration and more aggressive drivability and still get great gas mileage. Additionally I upgraded the stock stereo with high-end JL speakers and power amp. now I have music and not noise while I drive. Obviously I highly recommend this car
