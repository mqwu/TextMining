I L-O-V-E this car!! When I first test-drove this car I liked it. The first week after I purchased it I liked it even more. Now after putting 2000 enjoyable miles on it I adore this car. This car will turn heads and can also zoom past some of the flashier sedans such as Lexus 300. I did test drive the BMW 3 series and found it to be pretty bland. Being a person who truly enjoys "driving" I am totally satisfied with my purchase of the C320. You can reach 100 mph without even realizing it and curves at 85 mph are a blast and a breeze.
