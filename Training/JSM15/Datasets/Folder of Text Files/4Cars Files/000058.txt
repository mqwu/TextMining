Incredible looks and by far one of the classiest looking cards on the road(yet very sporty and modern) smooth & powerful engine feels like V8. i have put 17 inch AMG rims and Michelin Pilots on mine a must over the stock rims and tires. I can not even believe that some people have complaints about this beauty. perhaps they should keep on driving the wanabees like lexus and Infiniti. Some people just dont't understand what Mercedes is all about!!! We owned several Mercedes Benzes and we were very happy with all of them. This one is no exception.
