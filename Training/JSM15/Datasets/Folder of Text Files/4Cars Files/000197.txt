The 540iA is without doubt a car with few peers. It accelerates like a scalded cat all the way to the 155 mph speed limiter. In spite of its almost 2 ton girth you can throw this car around like rag doll and never come close to loosing control. It is as solid of a car as I have ever driven. The chassis is tuned so that bumps are simply absorbed and never make it to the occupants. The elastically attached aluminum rear suspension also helps in this area. No other luxury sedan(and some are using the name lightly)on the market provides such a great sounding V8 that shifts at the 6000 RPM redline with such ease. If you get this car then realize that you will probably never be happy with anything else.
