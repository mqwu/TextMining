I really like this car. I have owned several new Hondas and loved their refinement and ride. No offense but the Mercedes is in a whole nother league. Which it should be I guess for the difference in price. Anyhow the car rides super smooth you can barely feel it running at a stop light and the brakes are superb. The only thing....with those great brakes come brake dust. Which there is alot of. Other than that I have no complaints. This car is loaded with little gadgets that most cars dontt even come with. It will be hard to pry me out of a Benzo for now on. Before I bought this car I test drove BMW 3 series and a Lexus 300....I like this car much better those two.
