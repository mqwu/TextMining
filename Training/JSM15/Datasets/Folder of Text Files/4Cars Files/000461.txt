I originally paid $33000 for this car in 1988 and purchased it brand new. It has been the best investment I have ever made when it comes to vehicles. This car has had extremely low maintenance costs has been problem free still drives like a new car is fun to drive and is still worth $5000+. I would highly recommend an CarZZ for a vehicle that is sporty fun to drive dependable low maintenance and holds it resale value. I have no complaints at all about CarZZ.
