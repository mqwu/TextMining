I was shopping for a used E320 but ended up with this with only 21K miles and still under warranty a steal! The styling is distinctive but doesnt't stand out too much which is a plus for me in NYC. A stealth car that is much faster and nimbler than it looks and the stopping power is unbelievable. I dont't know if this also applies to E320s but the road feel is almost too much (although the ride itself is smooth). Still I'd rather have too much than too little. My biggest complaint is that the cellular phone that came with the car is of the old analog type that is pretty much useless (only Verizon has a plan that supports it at a ridiculous cost). Unfortunately it can't be upgraded to digital unless you want to pay mondo $$$. I was looking for a new Volvo S60 or a loaded Passat but instead got an entree to automotive heaven for less money. If you're looking for a new upscale sedan in the $30K range I would recommend checking out used E320 or E420 Benzes first. There is just no comparison.
