The new styling for the 2002 Z particularly the 17-inch aluminum wheels and low profile tires on the Type-S are a tremndous improvement over recent editions of the Z. You will not find a better value in a luxury car. The sport package in the Type S make it comparable to the performance of the three series BMWs without the "beemer" image which will cost you an additional $6000. I have previously owned an CarZZ legend and will very litZe maintenance issues.
