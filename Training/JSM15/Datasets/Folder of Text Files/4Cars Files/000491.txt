I searched for several months after I narrowed my search down to an E36 M3 waiting for an E46 M3 or an E39 540i/6-speed. I love the 540 more every time I get in it. Here is my opinion on some of the common complaints that I heard in my research: Cup holders - these are marginal. I am constantly throwing containers that dont't fit snugly out on corners and while accelerating. Interior Storage - Now that I am used to putting my stuff in the door and not in the console I have no complaints. There is a surprising amount of room in the doors. Interior wind noise - Minimal - if you are getting any try closing the moonroof cover (or whatever you call that thing). If that fails try using door sealer treatment as recommended on bmwtips.com. DSP Stereo - I like mine and think that it is worth the $1200. However if your name is Billy-Bob or Cleetus and you want to rattle the neighbors windows then save your money and get an aftermarket upgrade. For the rest of us the DSP is more than adequate. 6-speed - Some say that it is hard to shift smoothly. All I can say is that they must need to practice driving a manual. I have never actually owned a manual before and I dont't have a problem with it. And no I dont't slip the clutch excessively. Also it is not bad in stop and go traffic - as I was led to believe. Mileage - I get 19 mpg in town and 26 on the road. Not bad for a 4.4L V-8. Unsporty looks doesnt't turn heads. Personally I love the understated looks. What percentage of 5 series owners want to attract attention? My next car... M5... if I can afford it! Otherwise I'll get an e60 (the next generation 5 series due out in 2003) with a V-8 (545i???)
