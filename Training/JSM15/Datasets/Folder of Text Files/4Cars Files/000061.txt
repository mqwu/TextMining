I have owned this car since 1999 (lease). I have had a few minor problems and the rotors had to be replaced but overall this car has been awesome. It has great handling and it is very comfortable on the inside. When my husband drives it he says - "this car is a machine" because it can accelerate fairly quickly in high speed (tip tronic). It has great handling around corners and during U-turns (I love this stuff). It's a very high-quality car and the audi service teams in both San Diego County and Ventura County have been great. You get treated like you are the most important customer at all times.
