I bought a black CLK320 with charcoal leather K3 package and 6-disc CD changer. I have been very impressed with the interior and exterior styling; I looked at just about every sport/luxury coupe available and this appealed to my taste the most by far. I looked at the new BMW 330Ci within minutes of the MB and the MB is a notch above but to be fair the BMW seems more focused on the sport aspect. I also looked at the Saab 9-3 Volvo C70 Porsche Boxster Audi A6 Honda Accord. You get what you pay for. So far I am having a blast driving this car. The ergonomics are great. The handling (steering and cornering) is surprisingly good for a smooth quiet luxurious ride albeit shy of my former Bimmer. It's a head turner too. The stereo rocks; good to have plenty of standard bass. The eccentric sweep mono-wiper is cool. My experience with the dealer (MB of Miami) has also been the best of my 3 new car purchases (knock on burl walnut).
