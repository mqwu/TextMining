The Lexus ES300 is an excellent value. It is incredibly reliable like most Toyotas. Despite popular chat from auto enthusiasts and armchair "experts" who merely monkey what they have read or heard this is not a Camry in a different body. Biggest complaint is cruise control losing memory below 20 MPH. Toyota drivers will be acclimated to this; drivers of other cars who depend on or use cruise control frequently will be frustrated. Considering this is the biggest complaint it is a wonderful car. If this is the nicest car you've owned you'll feel like you have arrived. If you want a sports sedan this ISN'T your car. The ES300 has good pickup and takes freeway onramps with muscle but it isn't a sports car. The handling is too cushy the steering too loose and the horsepower too low for a sports car. This car achieves its goal very well. If you want a sports sedan look into an Audi S4 or nicer BMW 3 Series.
