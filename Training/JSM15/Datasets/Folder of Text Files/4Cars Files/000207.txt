I absolutely love the smooth drive it is easy to go too fast. However the brakes are problematic. When my car is not driven for a few days it is likely that the brakes will fail. My husband and I have both experienced this MAJOR flaw and have had the Z in for repairs three times. The first service (by Virginia dealership)resulted in a new master cylinder and the subsequent services (by South Carolina dealership)have left the problem unresolved.
