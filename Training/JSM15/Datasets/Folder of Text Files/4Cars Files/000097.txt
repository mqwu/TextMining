This car is kind of expensive once you load it up with everything. The 5 series does have a better suspension but I guess you can't have everything. This car does get a lot of looks especially with the sports package and xenon lights which are great. Non-xenon lights just dont't cut it anymore. Rides kinda choppy on uneven surfaces and skips. Not the thing you should see in a car of this caliber. Brakes are excellent which I can't say is true on an LS400. Stereo is garbage too for a $60000 car. Comparing this 1999 car to a 1991 LS400 with Nakamichi puts this Bose to shame.
