I really enjoy the car....when it's not at the dealer for repairs. It's fun to ride with the covertible down on a sunny day. It handles well. However I dont't think that I will purchase another one considering the amount of problems that I have had in the short amount of time that I have had the car. Please do your research before purchasing.
