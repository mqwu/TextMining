I bought it as a "weekend" car to be used sparingly. It's accumulated 12000 miles in 5 (winter) months. The grin factor doesnt't go away. We choose back roads and small towns and almost every weekend is now spent driving mountain roads in northern Arkansas or some such place. It's exactly what my wife and I wanted. It's almost as much fun as a motorcycle but without the disadvantages. It's hard to justify the price but it's a bargain when you consider some other cars in its class. You're never alone if you need help. It's a little spooky to have "the voice" come out of the dash but the service is first rate. It gets a little more attention than desired. Sometimes I wish it had a stealth mode.
