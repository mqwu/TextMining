Bought it used a year ago and have put 21k on it. Absolutely the most enjoyable car I have ever owned. It is a true "drivers car." The suspension is a perfect blend of comfort and handling. Acceleration is starZing. Before I bought it I tried Lexus LS400 Lexus GS400 Infiniti Q45 and several others. Nothing compared. Buy a new one if you have $58k to spend on a car. Buy used if you dont't have or dont't want to spend the $58k. It's a great car.
