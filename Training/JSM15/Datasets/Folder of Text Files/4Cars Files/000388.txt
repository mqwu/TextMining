Great Car Enjoyed all the Luxury - Sound System Power Seats Leather Moon Roof etc etc... but it did not handle well enough so I took out the standard 15' Wheels and put IS300's 17 inch wheels. Now I can do quick corners and always stay in lane even at high speeds. And it's a lot of fun to drive. No problems at all very reliable.
