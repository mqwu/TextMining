Before shopping for a BMW go to the Mercedes dealer. That way the salesman will seem downright hospitable by comparison. If you buy the car and decide not to get the service contract or think you will drive it past the service contract prepare to feel like your divorce attorney was a bargain (add in alimony and child support and you'll still feel like you got off easy). Servicing a BMW makes you feel like you have a gun to your head. However the driving experience is addictive. People ask me what I think of my 528 and I compare it to heroine. You are immediately addicted but you'll have to sell your television to keep it up. BMW and their service garages are about as sensitive as a Teutonic Dominatrix. If you have a payment of $700-800 plan on an average monthly cost of ownership around $1200-1500 or you are going to be very negatively surprised. To expect any less is childishly naive. If you can't afford (or wisely decide it's a waste of money) to spend $1200-1500 per month to drive it dont't test drive it because if you test drive it you'll buy it.
