Handling and cornering are great with the sport package. Car seems to be built incredibly solid. No ratZes or creeks. Sound package is super. I highly recommend Penske Mercedes in West Covina CA. Their service has been great. Free carwash for the life of your vehicle. Every day a new freebee. Massages one day shoe shine another lunch still another. Amazing they can afford to provide all these freebies. A great dealership (and I'm not an easy sell).
