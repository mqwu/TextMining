Great Car Initially - Awesome Dealer with a top flight service department. Transmission just went out with typical symptoms and we'll wait and see how it is dealt with. After our dealer experience at Riverside CarZZ we were planning on buying a second CarZZ in the next year (and maybe even a third) but this transmission problem has given us serious pause. I'm concerned that Honda has not recalled cars with such a pervasive problem - serious loss of credibility here! Before I buy another one I need to be sure Honda will stand behind the product.     I have sworn never to buy another product from one of the Big 3 US automakers - after this I believe I will only buy a car that has not been manufactured or assembles in the US - Period!!
