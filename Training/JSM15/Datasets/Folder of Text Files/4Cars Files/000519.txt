"Love at first sight"....this car was sitting in the middle of a Lamborgini dealership so I had to buy it for its performance value and MB prestige. After the first test time I stopped my car search and drove it home 2 hrs later. Like any new (European)car small annoying problems exist. That's why I purchased the extended warranty. Luckily the car has been near-perfect. Imagine waiting for the red light to turn green while other drivers stare at your car and in 6.1 sec they are in your rear mirror. Don't let the valet boy out of your sight!
