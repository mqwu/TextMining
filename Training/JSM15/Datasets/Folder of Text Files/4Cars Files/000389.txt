This car truly is an incredible vehicle. if you are lucky enough to afford a 50000 dollar car i cant think of another place to spend it. You get the safety security cargo cappacity passenger comfort of a full size sedan as well as get the performance of a 2 seater sports car. As you drive down the road you can't help but smile at how great this car really handles. the steering is perfect and the ride/quiteness of the cabin is ideal at high speeds. I had the car up to 125mph (shhhh) and felt in complete control!! After having a car of this calliber i dont't know if i can ever go back to a "normal" car. If only the price was not so high it would be the best car money could buy. What kind of person would drive this car? Well.... anybody. Anybody that enjoys performance and luxury wrapped into one great package.
