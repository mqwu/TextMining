After driving European sedans for the last 7 years I bought the ES 300 because I was getting tired of all the repair bills on my 1999 Saab 9-5 (about $4000 in repairs over the last six months of ownership). The ES 300 is a much more refined car than the Saab. The engine is powerful but very quiet. I am very impressed with the transmission and have had none of the sudden acceleration stalling problems that others have noted. There is considerably less road noise than in the Saab. The seats are even more comfortable than the Saab's (which are quite good also). Handling is a bit different but the ES 300's steering is still quick and responsive. The ES 300 also has much less body roll than the Saab. The only problems I've had so far have been rattles inside the car which stand out more than in other cars because there is so little road and engine noise inside the cockpit. The dealer takes noise problems very seriously and has eliminated them all. I'm very pleased with the dealer experience so far. The Saab had a few features that are missing on the ES 300 but overall I'm very pleased and trust that I will spend considerably less time and money on repairs.
