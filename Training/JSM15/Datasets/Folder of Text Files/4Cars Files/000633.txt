I was looking for a sport sedan with an automatic since I have back problems. I have test driven some of the other luxury models and found them wanting in some respects. This car has it all--speed handling braking comfort enough luxury goodies to ride long distances 4 door practicality and good looks. Although not inexpensive for what you get(including the AMG modifications) this car is a relative bargain!
