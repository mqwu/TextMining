One of the worst cars ever! Would never buy it again. It looks great and the hardtop works like a charm but the shoddy build quality and the terrible handling make this a car to avoid. I think that it has ball and joint steering (as opposed to the much superior rack and pinion). It has a total lack of feeling though the steering wheel. The Sport package is a rip off as everything on it is purely cosmetic. This is the ultimate poser car- talks the talk but cannot walk the walk. Also the dealership treats me like crap. I'm young and they avoid me like the plague. They are always rude and seem stuck up (to me at least). I noticed that the floors and walls were lined with marble and the waiting room has a Sony Wega TV set in it. Just sitting in that room wonders how much they ripped me off.
