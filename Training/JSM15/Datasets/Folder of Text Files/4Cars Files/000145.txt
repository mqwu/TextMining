Trade my 96 accord for a touch of luxury a 93 lexus gs300 nice car good looks but I think i Got a lemon or the original owner did no repairs to it. Oil leak from start $1500 to fix air condensor broke dealer replaced but then the hoses were leaking  then after 3 months fuel pump broke ($400 to repair) would have loved to keep car put new rims brakes shocks and springs even up graded the sub woofer quite a head turner but the repairs were a killer for a car in the lexus name. FINALLY HORN BROKE ONE DAY .Finally traded the car in for a more reliable brand Honda accord. won't buy another lexus again nice car but its still a toyota with a different name and more costly repair fees.
