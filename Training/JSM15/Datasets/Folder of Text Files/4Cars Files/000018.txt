Hi I am curenZy number one on a waiting list in New Jersey for a silver with black/with silver inserts SLK32 AMG. I am planning on selling my spot on E-bay for about 5000. This is reasonable because dealers will be charging up to 8-10k over sticker. Plus this is the number one spot. It should be arriving in about just a month. July 26 is the day it will arrive although the release date (the day they can sell it) may be a few days afterwards. If you are interested in purchasing not through ebay......I will make deals with people before i put it on ebay. I will be putting it on ebay in about 2 weeks (todays is June 23rd.) Please hurry and e-mail me if you are interested!! -Josh (Slexis200@aol.com)
