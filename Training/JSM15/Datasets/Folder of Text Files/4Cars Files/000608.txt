Contrary to what some Eastcoast owners think we have NO RATZES and NO SQUEAKS and the use of plastic doesnt't bother us. The transmission is the best we've ever had. Everything works fine and it hauls a**. The dealer replaced 2 sensors when we first got it and it hasn't been back since. We were supposed to wait 4 more months for our car to be built but last xmas they couldn't find the guy who ordered this blue beauty.... so we sure do like his car ha ha. My husband says it cruises at 120 in the deserts of Nevada as quieZy as it does 65 on the LA freeways AND every car we pass isn't another clone of us.
