I bought a Star certified C230 about 4 months ago. I enjoyed every moment of driving the car. Having experience buying cars from Toyota Honda and VW I rated my local MB dealer at the very top. They are quite polite and very professional.     With a price tag of little over 20k the C230 comes with many luxury items/options more than what I expected. The engine is powerful. Although the engine in the 2002 C230 model does sound a little bit coarse.    This is my first Mercedes. But it certainly won't be the last. I plan to purchase a E55 or E500 in the next 3 years.
