I have owned the car for only 1 week but I already have fallen in love with it The ride and response is exellant. With many features that would only come on a more expensive model I am very happy with the deal. Compared to the Lexus 300 that I test drove and the BMW I feel the TL is hands down the better bang for the buck. Hold to your guns for a good deal on the TL I held out for 3 weeks and finially got the deal I wanted with Gold trim and extra wood trim thrown into the package for free.
