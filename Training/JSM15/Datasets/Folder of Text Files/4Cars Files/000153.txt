I am impressed with its handling. It isn't a sports car so dont't drive it like one. The CD changer in the trunk is weird but they did improve that wiht the later models. I also drove the 1997 ES300 and it's not that different than mine as far as handling they are really nice to drive very smooth. The cup holder is in a strange place also but oh well. It is a beautiful car fun to drive and I am very suprised that it holds its value as it does. Yes when I am able I will absolutely without question buy another Lexus ES300. I am completely hooked.
