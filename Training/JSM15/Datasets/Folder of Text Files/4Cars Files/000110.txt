Get me out of this car! I have two young children. Last week as approaching the 605N from the 5 coming home from work my tires locked up out of no where. All the cars behind me swerved going everywhere to advoid me. I had no idea what was going on I just tried to control the car and get to the side. I called my husband from my cell phone and he sent a tow truck. Later we heard this is a common problem. I didnt't pay $33000 to get into a brand-new car with problems. Once this car gets back from the dealer I'm going straight down to get my await Mercedes!
