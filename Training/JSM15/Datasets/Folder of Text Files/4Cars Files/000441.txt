RecenZy bought a 99 Z with Navi from a private seller. It is a silver with black interior. It seems that I have got a very good deal as the dealer will not let go of a similar car for less than 22k. It has around 35K miles on it and under warranty till early 2003. My first pre-owned car. Also my first Japanese (Made in US though) car. Bought it to get a good resale value.    So far so good. But you all know how it is when you buy a pre-owned car. You are always (aZeast initially) skeptical about it.    Also I am extremely disappointed with the Radio Reception. Why did they ship the car with such poor audio reception ? I realized it only after I bought the car. I would have driven almost all expensive and non-expensive American cars but non had that problem. Why integrate the antenna in the rear window glass (duh ?)  Does anybody know how to fix the radio problem. I love to listen to the radio. Can somebody send me an email at jigsboy@yahoo.com and let me know.    Also I am planning to buy extended warranty on this vehicle. Better safe than sorry. Who would you recommend ? I mean an CarZZ dealer or on-line ? How much should you get it for ?    Also I got confused with the features after test driving so many different cars. I thought this car had memory seats and dual climate control. But I guess not.     But nevertheless I am happy about the car's loaded features. The Nav system is great. Something different to cheer or feel good about.    So far I like what I hear about the 3.2 Z. That makes me feel good.    Thanks.
