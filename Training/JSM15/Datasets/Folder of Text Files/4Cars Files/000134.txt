I haven't had this car long enough to make a long term review but here are my initial impressions since I have driven it for 24+ hours.    Typical CarZZ feel and quality which is nice. However it doesnt't have that tight solid feel of the Lexus IS300 or the BMW. There is a certain perfection in the way the wheel feels in your hand and the car reacts to driver input with these other cars. I was very surprised that Lexus had figured out how to duplicate that German feel. However that German feel comes with a price tag and usually high repairs/maintenance costs.    The Type S has great acceleration and CarZZ has donte well with the gearbox though many reviewers have had problems. For the money I am not sure you can find a car that offers so much performance refinement and that wonderful Honda reliability. The Tyoe S is not as common but I feel based on my limited driving that it is worth the extra money.    I haven't purchased this car yet but I am very close to doing so. It doesnt't run like my 03 vette but for a four door it boogies. I just wish it had better styling. I would put a body kit on it(no spoiler) lower it about 1" and go with wider wheels and tires. This is a nice ride but it needs to distinguish itself from the Accord and the Type S should be more agressice than the base model the 17" wheels dont't really change much visually.
