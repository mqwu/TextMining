When I first bought my black Mercedes-Benz C220 from the showroom and drove it out with this new car smell I fell in love with it. The car gave me no problems so far. I have put 87000 miles on it and it still gave me no problems. My black C220 still looks like a new car because I kept it detailed every week and I perform a regular scheduled maintenance service without missing any. I do my oil change lubrication every 4000 miles eventhough it tell me to do it at 7500 miles. I take this Mercedes-Benz to Smythe European Authorized Mercedes dealer everytime I am due in for a service they treat me very well. I have all the service records including invoices in my maintenace book stamped. Overall rating I give my Mercedes an excellent rating and I will be a Mercedes-Benz customer for life.
