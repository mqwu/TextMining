All around a great buy. This car has everything u would wanr out of a 2.8 liter sports sedan. Its got a pimpin lookand it handles like carzy. The one thing i did not like was the stock speakers(no bass).the only thing i will choose over this car is a 540i six-speedand the all time great m5(both are bmw'sand 5 series). There is nothing more to say BMW's are the #1 SPORTS/LUXO cars out their.
