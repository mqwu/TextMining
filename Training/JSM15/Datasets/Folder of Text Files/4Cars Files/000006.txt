I love this car. I've been driving BMWs for 13 years and this is my favorite. My brother has a 94 318 and I like that style but it feels like a step down. Mine's a 1990 but looks newer thanks to BMW keeping the style for 6 years (Not three like a Toyota and then they change the style so much you feel like you got ripped!). Had a lady hit my taillights last month and she thought my car was new. I've just hit 100K and it still is so fun to drive. Put a Dinan chip in a year ago and it brought some pep in (human nature to get acclimated). There is just something to driving a BMW that I won't feel in other cars. You can take the Lexus out of the garage but you can't take the Toyota out of the Lexus!
