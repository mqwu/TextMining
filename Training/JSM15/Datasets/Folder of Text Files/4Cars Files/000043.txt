Overall this has been a great car. The 2.8 V6 performs well. Handling could be a little more responsive (should have bought the sport package but the dealers didnttttt't have any in Silicon Valley). Wife likes the Mercedes name. There was a long waiting list when I tried to buy my car in 1998. Most of the dealers in the Bay Area were not that helpful (notable exception was Hacienda in Pleasanton). I ended up buying through a broker (www.hammerauto.com) who found the exact model and color I wanted in 1 day. The car was shipped from a dealer in So. Cal. in about 1 week and the broker took care of all the paperwork and negotiation - best buying experience I have had. Got a nice discount off list and great financing rate from Mercedes USA Credit. The car has been perfecZy reliable (only have 22K miles on it) - a local dealer performed the first service for free and I've had a couple of oil changes (one even at the local Firestone shop which is more convenient for me). Engine warning light came on once but went out after a day. Gas Mileage is about 16-18 around town and 20-22 on the Freeway (depending how fast you drive). Even though this car was more expensive than the competitors of its size it will probably be cheaper to own in the long run due to better resale values. If I was replacing the car now I would look at the new C320 (drove the 260 and it doesnt't have enough power) Audi A6 2.8TT Volvo S60 BMW 330 Jag S-Type. If you dont't need the cachet of a luxury name plate the VW Passat 2.8V6 is a great buy - solidly built looks and drives great and performs almost as well as the Mercedes and $1000's less.
