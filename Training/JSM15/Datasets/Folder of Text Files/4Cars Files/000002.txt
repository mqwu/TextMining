I'm a high school senior and I'm lucky enough to have this car on lease. I haven't driven any other luxury cars so I have nothing to compare my experience to. While my friends are driving Celicas Integras and Civics I'm more than content with this vehicle. The stereo system is bumpin extremely smooth ride and the seats are very comfortable; I love driving.
