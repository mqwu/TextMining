 I paid $28100 for the car a fair price. This dealer is the best for service of any I've run into in my 45 years of driving so I wasn't about to quibble. There is NO CAR I know of that delivers this much at this price period. As I said earlier if you need a car this size that's this good the competition begins with the BMW 5 Series.
