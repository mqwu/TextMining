In a word WOW! I initially was interested in the Z version (why do I need a sports car?) but my color of choice was not available locally or within 200 miles. After test driving the Z I test drove several other vehicles and was leaning toward buying the Lexus ES 300. I then test drove the Z-S and fell in love with the car. To get this kind of performance you have to spend in the 40K + range. The engine has a nice purr (smooth!) and it corners and accelerates beautifully. The seats are comfortable but not quite like my old 92 Volvo 940 turbo (fit/finish and ride blow away the Volvo)
