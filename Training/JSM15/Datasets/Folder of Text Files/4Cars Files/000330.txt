I purchase a new car every 2 years and this is without a doubt one of my favorites.It gets a lot more attention than the corvettes I've owned. The quality is very good and it handles great.It's just a fun car to drive.One night I hit a pot hole and ruined a tire.I called the 24 hour Mercedes service they showed up in 20 minutes and were excellent. This is one outstanding product and I'd recommend it to anyone except a young kid.Buy one and see
