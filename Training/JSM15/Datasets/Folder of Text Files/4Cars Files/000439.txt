The Honda motor company makes great products. Not flashy but represent solid value. Just check Accords Civics Odessey MDX 3.2Z all class toppers. I have been driving their products since 1983 when I bought my first Accord. In 1986 I bought the new EX. I kept that car for many years and put on over 330000 KLM or 204k miles. I gave it to my neighbour who has put on another 100KLM or 62k miles.    In 1997 I bought a used 92 Legend LS great car. Beautiful design. I bought it for $19500 used it five years and traded it for a 1998 3.5RL. With the trade I paid 19500. I have been driving this car for about two months and to date nothing has caused me displeasure. I love this car especially to drive. The shape is also growing on me.    The 3.5 is the Rodney Daingerfield of Luxury cars. It is the victim of snobbery from BMW Lexus and Benz driver and want-to-be drivers. It gets no respect and that is just fine with me. If more of those snobs would get off their high horses and step into the RL the streets would be crowded with them. Then I would not feel so Special!!
