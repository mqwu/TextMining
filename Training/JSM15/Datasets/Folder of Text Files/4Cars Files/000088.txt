I love driving this car. This is my 4th MB and this is the one I enjoy driving the most. It's fast rev's nicely has 95% of the amenities of my wife's E320--which costs almost 2X--and has a better feel in the suspension and steering. Sport seats are a bit stiff (not sure a 12 hour drive would be pleasant) but I use it to commute and for around town. It's more practical than the SLK due to 4-seats cargo holding.
