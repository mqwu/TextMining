Great value in a used car. I bought mine with only 50000 KM (30000 mi) it cost half the price of a new one. Still drives like a much newer car. Very quiet. Comfortable luxurious interior (mine has leather & CD changer heated seats etc.). Fair gas mileage. A great highway cruiser just eats up long trips.
