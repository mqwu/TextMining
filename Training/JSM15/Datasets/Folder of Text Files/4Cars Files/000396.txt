Extremely reliable It nice to buy a car where everything works. I've own the 525 for 2 years and had a problem with a minor noise in the dash. The dealership test drove the car and found the noise and remendy it by replacing the whole dash. I received the car back clean and quiet and everything working as it should. They went the extra mile without any argument. I dont't know if it is the dealership or BMW But you could not asked for a better automobile. I have just purchase a BMW Z4 and NO Problems.
