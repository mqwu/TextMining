I bought the 2001 CLK320 coupe because I loved the looks of the car. The engine needs more power and I wish I could have afforded the 8 cylinder. The brakes are great. They never fade. The interior is poorly donte full of cheap plastic an stiff leather. My car like many others suffers from a slew of rattles. The car handles like a Cadillac. There is much too much body roll. All in all I dont't think I received $47000 worth of car and I'd never buy another. Hello BMW?
