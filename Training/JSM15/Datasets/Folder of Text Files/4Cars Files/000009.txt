FirsZy I am not stricly an owner of one fo these so my opinion is quite neautral. I was shopping around for a vehicle and I tried both petrol and diesel variations of this car. A total disaster on the part of Mercedes Benz. The diesel felt (sounded and performed) like a van patrol was not much better and I was scared to touch any of the switches in case I broke them. I ended up selecting a Jaguar. To be fair Jag is not as loaded as a Merc but it gave more confidence and I was able to turn the switches with confidence!
