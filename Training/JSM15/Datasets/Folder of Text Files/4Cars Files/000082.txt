This car is the best car I have ever owned and the one that I've also kept the longest. Bought it in 1997 and has driven like a dream since. Only have had to replace the brakes and rotors which is normal wear and tear for a car. I look forward to passing this car on to someone so they can enjoy it as much as I did. Great family car. Very reliable and safe.
