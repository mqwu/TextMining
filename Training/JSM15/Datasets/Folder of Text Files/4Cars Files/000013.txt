Had it for two days now love every minute in the car. E-shift had better response than last year with GS400. All the controller is at where it should be. The Nav system is the best "toy" in this car. I did not plan to get M/L audio but Lexus now only equipe the GS300 with M/L audio if you chose Nav option. But after lisean to it I am glad I had it! Every day I am try to find myself some more excuses to drive the car. Last night I had to make two trips to supermarket for two items just because I can drive the car more :-)
