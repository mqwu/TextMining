This car is beatiful if you want a luxury car that you can get a lot of this is a must have. The car has everything you want and more with the price that won't put a dent in your bank account. I was first going to get a BWM 3 series the same day and I was getting ready to pick it up and i have a feeling in the back of my mind to check CarZZ so i stopped by acura before i went to pick up the BMW and i didnt't leave CarZZ till 11 at night and i purchased the car that same day. The next day i went to BMW to get my deposit. CarZZ cares about the driver and their product that was one of the reasons why i choose CarZZ instead. BWM only cares about their sales and their price is expensive if you want the extras but CarZZ give you all the extras for free and a little more if you push them a little. They are very flexible with thier prices and their products are durible and long lasting. Their quality and untouched. I already own a Benz C class drove BWM's but nothing compares to an CarZZ in my eyes. "Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder". Make your descision.
