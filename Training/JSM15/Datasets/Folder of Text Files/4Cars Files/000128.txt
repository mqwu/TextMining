spacious powerful and durable. Dealers need to keep some standard. Took the car to Ed Napletons CarZZ For my Navigation Pin. They said the navigation has to be replaced and it would cost me $3500. I took it to another dealer and he fixed it. It was the wrong pin. When i called back Ed Napleton They said it is not their problem. so if i Spent 3500 replacing the navi it would have been a waste of money. so CarZZ should keep some standards who their dealers are. Ed napleton couldnt find my key either. I had to drive a loaner car .service is very bad.
