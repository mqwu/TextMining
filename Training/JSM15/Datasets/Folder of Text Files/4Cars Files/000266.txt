This car is priced similarly to the Merc E200(new) in Singapore at US$130k(cars cost a bomb here in Singapore). Was driving a Merc E200 previously and the GS300 trashes it in every way possible except for the prestige that the 3-pointed star brings. Singaporean drivers place more emphasis on prestige and status than on the performance of the car itself. The Merc E200 handles like a whale on rollerblades has a weak engine and is lousy at low RPMs and the interior just plain sucks. Support and aftersales maintenance/service is excellent which is a hallmark of the Lexus marque. Raced with a BMW 728i a week ago at a traffic junction and left the Beemer eating dust :) Did the same with a CLK :) Compared to the BMW 520i the BMW handles better but the interior just does not reek of luxury that the GS300 exudes. The S-Type is very nice-looking but cost a lot more and I have doubts about its reliability. The S320 and Passat are just waaaaaay outclassed. All in all a very good sports sedan disguised as an executive salon. A real pleasure to drive or be driven in. Highly recommended. Only qualm is that the GS300 really eats petrol (Octane 98 in Singapore is approximately US$0.8 per liter) and there is that irritating wind noise when the car is travelling 100kmh and above.
