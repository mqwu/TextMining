The worst car I have had in over 35 years of motoring was a 1995 Mercedes-Benz (Merc)C280 with all the bells & whisZes. It cost me £36000 which equated then to $54000!! Yes in the UK cars are a lot dearer. The dealers though judging by some of the reports here are just as bad as in the US. When I collected the car it had loud speakers missing from the door trim ( found later in the trunk) scratches where the aerial had been fitted - because in 1995 a radio was a cost option on a Merc! and at $750 dollars for a basic radio was a rip-off. Other defects abounded. The driving experience was dull - overall then a poor buy. I've since found Lexus and have no complaints. Long live Toyota! I hear that the build quality of the latest Mercs is questionable - UK cars are built in a Merc factory in South Africa ( they also drive on the left hand side of the road ) so maybe US cars are built in Germany still? - which beggars the question "why are there so many complaints about the inferior build quality of these cars?" Winston Churchill said affectionately of GI's in England during WWII " They're over-paid over-sexed and over-here" I could paraphrase that and say - the three pointed star is over-rated over-priced and every-where!
