I would most definitely recommend this automobile to friends and family. I feel very secure and important in this vehicle since I get alot of looks in it. I also purchased my vehicle from a local auction and saved well over 6 grand than what the dealers are asking but thats the advantage of having friends in high places. Service for this car is rather expensive. I took it in for a 45000 mile checkup (oil tranny check wipers etc) and it cost me over $500 dollars. Service personel very friendly and helpful but they should be for the cost.
