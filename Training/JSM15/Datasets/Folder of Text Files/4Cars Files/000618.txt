Avoid this car! I've been driving mine for over a year and a half...nothing but problems. The transmission needed to be replaced at 12000 miles. I'm told that EVERY model needs a new transmission (the '02 and '03...I'm waiting on the results of the '04 but I expect the same). Transmission is not only deffective but DANGEROUS! Mine went out causing me to crash. Cerritos CarZZ (avoid them too!) only wanted to replace the transmission and not repair the body damage at first. I had to haggle for them to repair the body damage and supply me with a rental car. A/C is not very cold. Bose Stereo is unreliable at best...I'm on my second and will get my third on my next service visit. Paint chips all over front bumper and scratches too easily. My rear view mirror was barely bumped and the housing broke causing the mirror to just dangle. The TL "wears" too fast...there is a lot of interior "noise" after 42000 miles. I bought an CarZZ because of friends experiences with the Integra...the TL is a complete Lemon. It took me almost 2 years to come up with the down payment for a new car. I wish I'd put that money down on an Infinity Audi or C-class. CarZZ places great emphasis on their "customer reviews" which the Service Department reminds you of every time you bring your car in for service. When you pick your car up after being serviced the service dept. asks you to bubble in "Excellent" on all the questions "just in case you are sent a survey". You'll deffinately get one after your purchase as well. Further Cerritos CarZZ tells you at the time of purchase that they have "loaner's" when you bring your car in for service. GOOD LUCK! You have to beg and stroke them for one! Usually the laoner's are "all gone". GET ME OUT OF THIS CAR!
