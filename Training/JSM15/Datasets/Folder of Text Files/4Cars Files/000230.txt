I have gad teh car now for three month and I actually picked it up in Germany on a European delivery - which was amazing. Then of course I actually got to drive the car - how it was meant to be driven - and it tops at 135 mph (320). I am not sure what the unsatisfied reviewers are talking about - but this is the best blend of class and sport in one car.
