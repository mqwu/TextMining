Buitiful Car. This car handles well and is quick to boot. The supercharged engine starts to make the ponies at approx 6k rpm. Nice sport coupe with the same engine as the slk230 kompressor. Was considering buying a 2002 Lexus 300I for 33k; glad I did not. Much better deal on the slightly used benz. Car is still under 50K factory warranty. Anyone who has driven a german car will realize there is just no comparison with a japanese car. Whole other ball game. A used german car may just be the best bang for your buck. Buy one slightly used and save $$$$.
