This is an initial review about the car. I just got it. I researched many cars before I came to the conclusion. I looked at the BMW 330i and Audi A4 Quattro. None can match the luxury of the Baby Benzo. Ride quality is excellent compaired to the other two. Acutally it's not even a fair compairson. The Benz caters more to the luxury craving individual. It does not have the sports like handling of the BMW. It was never meant to be. People always talk about how the connection between the driver and car is so strong in the BMW. If that's what you want then get a BMW. The benz is pure luxury and ride comfort is grade A. It has a host of safety features that other cars do not have. It has little features that make you say wow every time you find them. If you want pure luxury driving pleasure and the oooh and ahhh get the Merc. I ordered my custom with the Comand System heated seats bixenon's with headlight washers drivers multi contour seats and C2 premium package with power window rain sensor power rear sunshade.
