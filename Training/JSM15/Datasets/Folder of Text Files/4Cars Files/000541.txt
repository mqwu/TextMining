Great car -- a blast to drive. I just completed a 2000-mile tour of Canada and Maine. On empty twisty back roads the CLK55 handled great at speeds close to 90 mph. If you love to drive you'll love this car. It's perfect for long haul high-speed driving. Comfortable and fun!    I upgraded to the 55 from the 430. The difference? Noise and ride. The 430 was very quiet and had a luxury ride. The 55 is noisier (much more tire noise) and has a harsher ride but the marked increase in power as well as the lack of lean in turns makes up the difference -- for me.
