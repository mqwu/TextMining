This is my second Honda product. This car has not really given me any major problems like some of these reviews I have read. The Navi works very well...in California. I like to travel. I have traveled across country to North Carolina and back. I have had my TL for 11 mos now and already racked up over 26800 mi.The bose system sounds good but could sound better. My TL still rides good on the 19x8 inch rims I put on it. The one problem I can think of mechanically is that I have a slight pull to the right and that was there before the aftermarket wheel package. I took it to the dealer with the original wheels and tires. They aligned it under warranty. They said that the problem was corrected but to date there is still a slight pull to the right. I was told that it was torque steer causing that. Overall for the price the car is not bad at all just a few minor things.
