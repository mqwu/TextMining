I would not buy this product again. The engine is fairly small for a sedan this size and while the performance is pretty good the interior annoyances are frustrating. My wife has a 1998 Chrysler Town and Country and has had absolutely 0 problems. She loves to give me a hard time about this as I've had numerous little things go wrong or break. Given that her car costs 1/2 of what this one costs I can see her point. She says BMW stands for Big Money Wasted!
