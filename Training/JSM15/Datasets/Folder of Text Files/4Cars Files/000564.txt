This is my second convertible. My first was a Z3 BMW. The SLK is a very nice looking car but it's built like a Yugo. Do you remember Yugo? The little econobox made in Eastern Europe. The SLK uses cheap plastic everywhere which leads to annoying squeaks. The car is made for touring. Do not ask it to negotiate tight curvy roads. The steering is entirely too ponderous for such an event. I dont't think the power provided by the 2.3 liter supercharged 4 is bad. It's not tremendously quick but it's ample. The whining noise the engine makes does get a bit long in the tooth however. I can not recommend this car.
