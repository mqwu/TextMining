I have enjoyed this car overall. The horsepower is impressive backed by a smooth shifting transmission. Handling is responsive and tight enough to get the job donte. The interior is clean and flows well. It has a love or hate dark wood/marble looking trim that I personally like and so does my wife. I have read articles claiming that anyone around 6 ft. tall will have a problem with the headroom. I am 6'1" and I have not noticed a problem. I also like the smooth crisp lines of the exterior. It looks classy but yet has that "I can't sit still" look.
