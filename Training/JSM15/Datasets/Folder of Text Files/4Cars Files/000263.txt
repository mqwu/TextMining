I purchased this car in 1998. People who doubt the power of the es300 are kidding themselves. A rather light four door that has plenty of leg room and tunk space for the big soundsystems. The only disadvantage is performance porducts are hard to find but this keeps people away from the model. Hey it's more fun to me. I think the Es300 has a throaty V6 that you usually dontt see in Hondas and Domestics. I take hondas and acuras by 2 seconds. The es3 has a good launch but has alot of wheel spin. I added a intake system and exhaust to make up for the weight of the sound system. I dontt know if working on the engine like nitrous and turbos would be worth it but it would be fun to try.
