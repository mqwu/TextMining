Almost bought a 1999 but chose the 2000 because of the addition of a five speed transmission and side air bags. Glad I did. After two years of driving this car I still enjoy it as much as my first test drive. After about 18 months of driving the internal heating wire under the drivers seat broke resulting in a loss of heated seat. Any problems I've had have been covered by the warranty. Probably will be an expensive car to fix after warranty expires.
