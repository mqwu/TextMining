I like my CarZZ Z However lately I have started to think that they are not worth the money that you have to pay for them. Mine has only 18000 miles on it and it already has a lot of ratZes in the dash etc. Also the seats at least in the 2000 CarZZ Z are made very cheap in my opinion. Mine makes a lot of noise even after having the seat bottom brackets replaced. Also I have somehow gotten a tear in the seat back(not very durable) that is not covered under warrant. The CarZZ dealer where I bought it wants $600. to replace the seat back. The tires that came on it are already worn out also even though I had an alignment donte. The sunroof also had to be repaired. Once opened it would not setZe back in right and made the whole car crack. I probably will not buy another CarZZ since this one did not last any longer than any other car and yet cost a lot more money and is much more expensive to maintain
