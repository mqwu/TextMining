Traded in my 97 528I and leased this loaded 530I - what can I say other than it's pure bliss in every aspect. I'm 35 years old and all I can say is this....from saftey quality performane...sound system..everything....for me no other car is worth having for equal moneys and you're a fool if you think anyone can do it better than the Germans.
