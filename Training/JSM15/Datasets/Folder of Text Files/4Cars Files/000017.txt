We've had our 2001 CLK320 for a few months now. It's a black car with the charcoal interior and all available options including COMAND Multi-Contour seats and Xenon headlights. This is the prettiest car I've ever owned. Everything about it looks right though my son tells me the rear end is reminiscent of a Civic. The 6 cylinder is not a bad engine but a neighbor has has the 8 cylinder and wow it's a much different car. The bottom line was that we didnt't want to spend any more money for a more powerful engine that we really didnt't need. The interior of our car looks great but we do have a few gremlins. The sunroof rattles less frequently when the sun shade has been retracted. The air vents in the dash also seem to rattle and the passenger seat seems to squeak. Also the passenger window will no longer express up. You have to leave your finger on the button to close the window. The only option that we find to be a waste is the COMAND. It's unnecessarily complicated and is not nearly as competent as the navigation system in my son-in-law's Lexus LS430. My husband replaced the bland stock wheels and had a set of the AMG/CLK 55 wheels installed. It's a nice car but a little disappointing considering all I'd heard about Mercedes.
