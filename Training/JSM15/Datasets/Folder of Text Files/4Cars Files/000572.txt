I WAS LUCKY TO PURCHASE MY 1998 230SLK WHICH CAME EQUIPT WITH THE LORINSER PACKAGE. IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS I HAVE PUT 500 MILES. OUT OF A POSSIBLE SCORE OF 1 TO 10 I GIVE IT A 8. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CAR FOR ANY LADY WHO WANTS TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION. AS FAR AS YOU GUYS ARE CONCERNED AS LONG AS YOUR NOT OVER 6' FEET YOU WILL HAVE A COMFORTABLE RIDE! GO FOR IT!
