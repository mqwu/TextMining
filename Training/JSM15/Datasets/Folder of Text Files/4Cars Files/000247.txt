Just got the car a week ago so I cannot talk about its reactions when pushed very hard but first impression is extremely positive. Firm yet smooth ride precise handling quiet and well-finished. Yes the faux-wood looks a bit cheap (in black which is one of the reason I chose a blue exterior/tan interior model) and the radio is not fantastic but those are fairly small stuff. I am 6'2" and have no problem with head room.
