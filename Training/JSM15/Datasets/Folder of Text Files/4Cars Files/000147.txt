After getting rid of Jaguar problemI was looking to get back to a Lexus product.I wanted to try the GS series rather than ES 300 which I have owned in the past.  I looked at both GS 430 and GS 300 and went with the GS 300.The main reason was the Sportdesign package offered with the GS 300 which gave me a more sport inspired ride.The realiability and finish on the GS is hard to beat.  Looked at BMW and they were not willing to work with youplus the fact their realiabilty has fallen down somewhat.
