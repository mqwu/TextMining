My wifes car but have driven it quite often. Extremely reliable. 90% highway driving and averages around 9Litres/100KM (30MPG Canadian or 25MPG U.S.) Very comfortable. No major problems in almost three years. Have had a few bad experiences with the dealership service. Likely due to my wife taking it in and they dont't seem to pay the same respect to a female as they do a male. Car is coming off lease and has almost 40000KM or 24000 miles over the lease limit. Our penality is alomst $8000 and they will not cover any piece of it for a trade in even if we were to buy a X5 that we were looking at. So looks like we will buy it and possibly look at purchasing an CarZZ MDX to cover the difference. Too bad really liked the test drive of the X5. Can't believe they are willing to lose a customer because their bottom line will only be about $2000 profit compared to $10000. Oh well think they are getting too comfortable and need a knock up side the head.
