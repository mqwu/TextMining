I traded a 1997 BMW M3 for the 1999 CLK 430. My decision was very easy not only from style but also performance. I have been driving the 430 since new. I feel the luxury the MB brings to the table is phenomenal. It is a complete joy to drive until winter rolls around. The fat rear tires along with the power do not provide a condusive environment for safe dontut free driving. Excluding the average ten days of snow...this car is a blast. Regular maintenance is relatively justified. All other makes and models that I would be interested in now have to live up to the 430 that is if I decide to trade it.
