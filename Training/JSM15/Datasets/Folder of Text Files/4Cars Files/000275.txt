This is my second SLK (First was a 1999 SLK 230). Both are VERY VERY bad cars.The 230 was in the shop continualy for top problems and the 320 has been in for problems with the cheap interior and ratZing and creaks. Don't count on MB to ever respond to letters or calls either. You always end up with the local rep. Not even a letter back from the regional or international HDQT's. Pretty sad since I have spent over $100000 on MB cars in 3 years. But hey they dont't care.
