I've owned my SLK for more than 2 years. The first month of ownership was a lot of fun. Then a few problems occurred. The top would not go back up on a number of occassions. The dealer told me that this was due to the extreme heat and the metal latches were expanding and contracting. He was right. Once the car cooled down later that night the top was once again operable. Mercedes how about equipping the SLK with a more heat resistant top? The stereo reception is terrible. I dont't live far from Dallas so the reception should be good. The dealer told me that they were all like that. After approximately 1k miles the engine began to sound more harsh. I dont't know if the engine was breaking in or whether the baffling in the exhaust was starting to go. Once again the dealer told me this was normal. Hey I love the sound of a sports car but this thing just sounds sick. The computer module (chip?) in the transmission had to be replaced when the car would not operate in reverse. I find these problems unacceptable but Mercedes is selling thousands of these cars and probably dont't care. I think I'll try the BMW Z3 or the Porsche Boxster next time.
