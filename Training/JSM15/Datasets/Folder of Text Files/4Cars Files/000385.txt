Leased vehicle 1st of Sept and haven't had a bit a problem with it. Really like the ride and performance. I was very concerned about the trans problem because i read about this problem before a leased the vehicle. I have over 4700 miles on it and its already Thanksgiving day and still running fine. I love how quite the interior is and the luxurious appoiontments within. The navigation system is the greatest and the Mark Levinson sound system sounds great.
