This is without a doubt the best car I've ever owned!! I could not be more pleased and if you're thinking about getting one - dont't hesitate. The value of this car what you get for what you pay is unmatched. Did I mention how fast this car is? Blowing by people on the road means just touching the gas pedal - OUTSTANDING!!! The suspension is firm but not harsh and transmits input from the road well. The interior is very comfortable and has some of the best seats I've sat in but shows where CarZZ saved some of the money. Sizing is excellent I'm 6'2" and 230 lbs. and I have room to spare (legs and head both). I can't even think of another car which could compete with the TL in the 30-35K range. Forget BMW or Lexus - BMW could hang performance-wise but you'll pay 40-45K for the same amenities same for the lexus but with out the performance. My buddy is still crying from when he compared what he paid to what I paid for what we both got. I believe he will be trading in in about 2 weeks. The car looks great is fast and handles great - CarZZ did their homework on this car!!
