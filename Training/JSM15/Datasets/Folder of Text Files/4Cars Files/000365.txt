Moving on to a real luxury car. This car was a good deal 3 years ago but now is too expensive for what it delivers. CarZZ delivers more bang for the buck. If you have the money step up to an Audi A6 turbo or BMW 525i or if you want more luxury a Jag S 3.0. Lexus is selling too many cars to keep the quality and residual value high for me to lease. I will have to pay over 100/mo to get the same car I have now and the price went DOWN!
