The ES300 isn't worth a dime. My '91 Caddy blows it away in every area including reliability. 130k miles and no problems on the Caddy. Guess I didnttttt't really need to buy the new Lexus after all. I already had the world. Hope the Lexus never bones itself as I dont't want to pay $7000 for an engine.
