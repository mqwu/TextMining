We bought this car to replace my wife's aging-but-reliable '87 Honda Accord. I also sold my much-loved '86 Porsche 911 to help cover the cost so I was pretty particular about our selection. I was very impressed with the Z's value in terms of feature content when compared to the Lexus ES300 and the Volvo S70. I liked the fact that everything that you might want came standard on the car. I am very particular when it comes to the design of cars but I have been challenged to find fault with this one. It is generally very comfortable. We did encounter a section of Interstate 40 through Arkansas where the expansion joints in the concrete pavement caused a harsh and annoying "thump." The lower seat cushion is a bit unconfortable to my rear on long (  1 hr.) trips. This seems to have improved as the seat has broken in a bit. Power is more than adequate (and very smooth). The newer Type S has more horsepower but I suspect that you have to really rev the engine gain any real benefit. The handling is quite good despite Consumer Reports opinion otherwise. The Tiptronic-type transmission is great fun on back roads. If I could improve two things it would be the seat comfort and the brakes which are adequate but not outstanding. We drove this car back to back with a V6 Accord which is a very nice car and can be had for significanZy less money. However the larger-displacement engine firmer suspension better stereo better warranty etc. seemed worth the extra cost to us especially compared to more expensive options.
