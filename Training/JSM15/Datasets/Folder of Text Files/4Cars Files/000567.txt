I loved the Z. My cousin's wife got the 2000 without much problems. Me well it's a different story. There's so many problems but most of all it's the tranny. After about 1 year and less than 20000 miles it went (late shifting over-reving before shifting up then slamming into gear slammed so hard the car shaked violenZy then the TCS turned itself off). It was like a standard tranny with a clutch gone bad. First time I took it to the dealer told problem was fixed as soon as I drove away I had to return. Nothing was donte. They took had the car for 2 weeks and replaced the tranny re-surfaced the front rotors due to related serious vibration and brake pulsation. The service dept. is a joke there. They will lie to you so that you must pay for a bad car. Anyway the worst problem is even with the new replaced tranny the problem is back again after less than a year again. My lease is up soon so since CarZZ sent the 7 yr/100000 miles extended warranty on the auto tranny and torque converter I guess I'll leave it up to the next poor person who gets it.
