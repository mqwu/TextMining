My 3rd BMW (1984 325e and 1990 535i) and I'll be a lifetime fan of BMWs. My 98 540 is fast good-looking luxurious and based on my other two BMWs which are still running with 230k and 175k miles I'll drive my 540 into the ground. The 540i is routinely rated a "Top 10" automobile and I concur. Though relatively expensive to purchase ( $50000) the total cost of ownership after 10 blissful years can't be much more than a run-of-the-mill domestic sedan. For those that just can't picture themselves in a Mercedes.
