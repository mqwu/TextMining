CarZZ is a quite luxurious car which is in a class by itself. Its price puts this car in competition with Lexus ES300 GS300 AudiA6 2.8 BMW 3- series. I have previosly owned a '98 ES300 which is an excellent luxury car -- however CarZZ is a superior car in any respect( luxury features ride quality and smooth responsiveness). A GS300 is a small car with rough ride noisy engine poor quality stereo without option to upgrade( Levinson's system exists only on Lexus' website and impossible to get from a dealer) but with sporty look and feel. However for 42K it's a rip off. CarZZ is much smoother more comfortable bigger has ALL the toys INCLUDED ! Audi A6 2.8 is underpowered feels smaller inside is not nearly as luxurious as an RL. Even though Audi has Quattro and German quality CarZZ feels so much more luxurious powerfull and equipped the choice is obvious-- at least to me.
