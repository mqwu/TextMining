a good driver's car as advertised as ultimate driving machine albeit at a very high cost of maintenance; reliability is its main achilles heel which is a turnoff to an otherwise nice driving machine.  lots of parts are made out of plastic to save weight as a result dont't last very long.  Disappointed with wobbly brakes jerky transmission and harsh ride and especially with reliability issue; very expensive to repair.  I 'd not buy again for reasons above even though it has excellent dynamic chassis. If only BMW can learn from the Japanese manufacturing prowess.
