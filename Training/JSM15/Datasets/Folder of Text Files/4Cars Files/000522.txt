This is truly a great car! I researched and test drove all comparables and this is truly the best (and most expensive). BMW is too common and plain in comparison. This Benz is not in the near-luxury class but in the luxury class. Looks like a smaller S Class same engine as E class and refined luxurious and sporty. Real head turner and snob appeal!Great product from a great company. Once you go MB you never go back!!
