Whew! I almost bought a Saab 9-5 SE. As fate would have it I made one last venture into Hendrick BMW and actually test drove a 525ia (anthracite w/ sand leather convenience sport/premium pkgs. zenons and in dash CD) which I bought the next day. This was after weeks of research and walking the lots. I was a little apprehensive about selecting the sport package due to my vast amount of city and interstate driving. My concern was the trade off in ride comfort in order to maximize the " driving experience". True one can feel the road and its imperfections however it isn't that obvious. The looks/handling features of the sport/premium pkg. is IMHO the only way to go.
