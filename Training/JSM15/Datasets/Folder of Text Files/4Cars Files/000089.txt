This is a phenomenal all around car but it NEEDS a 6 speed manual as an option. It is not a car for the timid; it can really get away from you. The power is instant and can really starZe the unknowing driver. My wife did not like driving the car for the first six months we had it (now she loves it and is always asking to take it). The car begs to go fast at 85mph it is just screaming to be unleashed. A quick blip of the throtZe and you are at 100mph. You really need to hold back and control you right foot. I've spent some time with the BMW 540 BMW M5 BMW M3 and Audi S4. The M3 ('98) is a bit more "precise" in handling but is no longer available in 4 door. Off the line the M3 ('98) will beat the C43 but once you are over 40... forget it the C43's power kicks in and you are history. It has been a great daily driver for just over the last year never a problem with over 15K miles logged to date. (given my summer car is a 993TT those 15K miles were compressed into ~7months) I will probably trade mine in for a BMW M5 for the additional room and the 6 speed.
