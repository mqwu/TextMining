I like my CLK430 Coupe. However there are too many problems that keep me from loving it. When you create a car that looks like the CLK430 how about including a suspension that can keep up with what the bodywork promises. I'd rather pay MB a bit more money for a quality interior. If you've driven MB's for any length of time you know that MB could do a lot better than what they give you in the CLK. That said the engine is wonderful as are the brakes. It's a very nice GT that needs a bit more attention to detail from Mercedes to make it a great car.
