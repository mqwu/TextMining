I test drove the new Jaguar X-Type and was going to buy it. Luckily I test drove the C320 first! This car has caught BMW & Audi equaling their stylish interiors and surpassing them. This car drives better than the competition not losing anything in sports performance. Additionally mercedez luxury is superior you dont't feel every bump in the road like BMW and Audi. Step up your game with the C series Benzo.
