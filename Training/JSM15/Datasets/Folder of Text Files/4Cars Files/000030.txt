I purchased the car used with less than 12000 mi. in July of 2000 (it came from Florida - probably from the Versace estate - plum color) for 37500. A steal! The mechanics of this car put other cars to shame. Quiet powerful pinpoint handling. You feel important in this car and have the ability to outrun most other cars on the road - not a good thing for the driving record as it is really easy to speed in this car (more like work to not speed). I agree with the other post regarding the assessment against the GS400 and 540i. This is my wife's everyday car and I wanted it to be sporty fun and safe. Also it had to be a reasonable family car. It is clearly the best of the three for putting a car seat into. We both miss having a manual transmission though. The car would be utterly dangerous with one though. One other note and it really swayed me. I looked into an after market extended warranty. The price for it was $1100 (4 years up to 75K miles). The price for a similar mileage GS 400 (a 1998 model year however) was $1000. The price for a 97 540i with the same mileage - a whopping $1900. As these prices are set using unbiased data you really get insight into the reliability and cost of ownership of the various models. And finally remember the Merc reputation for safety. There is nothing not a mini van nor SUV that I would rather have my wife and daughter riding around in. Now off to get a C43 for me!!
