I think Honda have gotten away from tradition on this one. I have had a number of problems Brakes (44 K Kilometers) Windshield wipers Seat Belt warning lights. The brakes were fixed after a fight. The other stuff they will only fix if I can prove a problem. They did give me a set of refinished wheels (corrosion). I did receive a notice that the transmission warranty has been extended. I also think the engine lacks torque (this is masked by the slick transmission). Never again. Run dontt! walk to your Infinity or Lexus Dealer
