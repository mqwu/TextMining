This car is over a year and a half old and we've already put 34000 miles in it but it still drives like it did the first day. There weren't too many of these out on the roads back in 99 but today it would be hard to miss one. And there is good reason for its popularity. This car is probably the best value in its class. The wonderful engine is smooth during everyday driving but can really scream when you feel like putting those 225 horses to use. The sportshift actually works and can be quite fun. Note the handling and ride characteristics are leaning towards the sporty side. which means it might ride a little harsh. If you like smooth and plush try a lexus but if you are into performace this car will do fine. The only thing keeping it back is the skinny stock tires but i guess they'll be fine for most people buying this car. Another complaint is the styling (or lack of). This car is plain! The 2002 models are getting a more agressive face lift but the overal look is still boring. Overall this is a very good car at a great value. Its personality stands halfway between luxury(Lexus) and performace(BMW) so it might not satisfy everyone. Test drive first.
