We owned a 2000 Celica GT-S which was a great funreliable car. But it was buzzykind of a boy racer look and didnttttt't have some of the extras that make long distance driving enjoyable. We had setZed on it after looking for 6 months for a well appointed coupe with some style that didnttttt't cost $60K. When we found the new coupe we were thrilled. I had my wife drive both the 230 SLK and the C230 Coupe and didnttttt't let her see the price tags. After driving both she actually liked the coupe better than the SLK and I had to agree with her. The SLK is nice but seems a bit austere in comparision with other performance oriented 2 seater and really isn't a practical car for those of us who deal with winters. Mercedes hit the market point perfecZy with the C-Coupe. The features are all there the huge sunroof is great the car is quick responsive and very ccomfortable to drive. All in all we are thrilled with our new silver C-Coupe!
