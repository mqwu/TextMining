I've had this car about 3 months. I test drove the Z and the Z type S. I went with the Z because I prefer a quieter ride and there is a noticable difference. And I felt the regular Z has plenty of power for my needs. I ordered it in the metalic grey with black interior and wood trim. Very pretty. (I felt the black/grey trim pieces looked awfull). The car is quiet with litZe wind noise and almost no road noise. I think the stereo is slighZy above average but not great. I love the navigation system. I wasn't sure about paying the extra 2 grand but it is a modern miracle. You cannot get lost with this thing and if you want to go somewhere on the spur of the moment odds are it will be in the menu. The car is easy to drive handles well is very confortable with very good seats. As everyone always mentions there is nothing out there with all this car has for a similiar amount of money. Throw in the CarZZ/Honda reliability and it is a tremendous value. Handling is pretty good although not as crisp as the German cars. Gas milage has been averaging around 24 mpg.I'm very happy with my choice.
