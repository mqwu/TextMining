Talk about a WOLF in SHEEPS clothing. This car has got to be THE sleeper car of the year. I actually surprised a Camaro Z28 as we were both merging onto the freeway. When he caught up and (finally) past by the driver nodded his head in admiration. Anyways while I dont't condonte drag racing sports cars I will say that it's sometimes necessary to open her up. Having 260hp on tap is a blessing in disguise especially since the car is so concervatively styled making stop light take off's and f-way on ramps sooo much fun. All this while I'm sitting in my perforated leather seat with the Bose stereo blasting and the climate control set at 68 degrees. Talk about being having your cake and eating it too. Just ask the Chevy guy.
