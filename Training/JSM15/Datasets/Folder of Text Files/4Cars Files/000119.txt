I have 25000 miles on this car after 18 mos. of use. I am quite pleased with it overall. The 235/45 17" tires do grab into grooves and ruts in the road but do make the car handle better. For winter I use 215/60 Blizzak MZ02's on Lexus GS300 take-offs. I was satisfied with these winter tires last year although it didnt't snow much. Yes I would have liked a BMW M5 but they're $70k and probably not as practical for day-to-day use and I use this car everyday for everything. Other than oil changes air and a/c filters and tires and wheels the only other expense will be $100.00 for the wheel alignment I'm getting tomorrow morning. It seems my tires wore on the inside much more than the outside at least on the front. So I'll be getting a new set of summer tires in the Spring. No big deal. Overall a very satisfying vehicle to own.
