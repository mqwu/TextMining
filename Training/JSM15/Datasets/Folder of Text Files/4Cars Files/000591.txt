I paid the $29000 Canadian (eqivalent of $18000-19000 U.S) for a 97 with 67000 km (48000 miles). The car is in superb condition throughout. Frankly I was surprised at how affordable the RL's are after 2 or 3 model years. In Canada a new RL is $54000. In my case I paid roughly 40% less than the original sale price for a car that in my opinion is barely broken in! Having looked at Mercedes BMW and Lexus I think the RL is either undervalued underappreciated poorly marketed or a combination of all three. The manager of the dealership where I purchased the RL told me after I bought it that many of his clients that have owned an RL have become almost loyal to the car. He also said that it is harder to get a new customer to purchase an RL than to keep an existing RL driver as a repeat client. He thought this was due to a lack of profile of the car when compared with the 3.2 TL which is heavily promoted. The question is would I reccommend the car? Absolutely.
