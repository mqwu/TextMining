We've had the car for nearly 4 months and it's an absolute joy to drive and we haven't even had an opportunity to put the top down yet!! Smooth efforZess power; quiet ride; confident handling and supreme comfort. The CLK Cabriolet is also a real head-turner I get looks almost every time I drive it and that's saying something in Chicago where Porsches Jaguars BMWs Ferraris and even Rolls Royces are fairly common. I've never kept a car longer than 3 years but I have a feeling this one's going to stick around a lot longer than that.
