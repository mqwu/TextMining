This car has spent more time in the shop than any car I've ever owned. The problems started with a check engine light and faulty fuel gauge and have continued to become worse. When it's running the car is enjoyable. The supercharged 4 cylinder is not very smooth but the power is OK. It's the type of car that feels like it's going fast even though it's not. All in all a lemon.
