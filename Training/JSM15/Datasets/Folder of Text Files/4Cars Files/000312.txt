Many criticize the Lexus ES300 as being a 'guised-up Camry' but really what's wrong with that?? The Camry has an excellent reputation for reliability and quality it looks good (for 2000 anyway) and its quiet. The ES300 has all of these qualities but even extends on them. The suspension on the Camry is a little too firm but the ES300 corrects that problem. With the Millennium edition the interior is gorgeous (black leather with bird's eye maple wood trim) The car can get pricey though and its a little tight in the rear seating area....but still a wonderful car
