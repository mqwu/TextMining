I'm generally pleased with this car. Acceleration is solid with minimal torque steer and the engine sounds great. Braking performance is OK but the feel could be enhanced. I'm also pleasanZy surprised with the gas mileage I'm getting which is more than I expected from a car with performance engine. I'm very impressed with the backseat and trunk space. The seats are very comfortable. Things I find lacking are the cheap fake wood interior and the weak sound system. It also would have been nice to have the availability of a standard transmission more color options and a rear windshield wiper.
