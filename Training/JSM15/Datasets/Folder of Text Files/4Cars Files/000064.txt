The car follows a 3 litre v8 BMW and a 4.4 litre v8 BMW. I read these reviews before I took delivery and wondered if I had made a mistake.    I assume that Mercedes sells cars to America that are differenZy set up from the European ones.    My car (my first Mercedes)is taut precise as fast as can be beautifully balanced in and out of corners (we have a lot of these in England) and a joy to drive anywhere in any conditions I have completely fallen in love with her something I NEVER thought could happen with a Merc - admire yes but love never !
