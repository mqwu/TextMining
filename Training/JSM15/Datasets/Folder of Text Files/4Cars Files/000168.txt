What an absolute beautiful car. I was on my way to a BMW dealership to order a 318i when I noticed a Mercedes dealership along the way and decided to compare their models not knowing that the new C Class was about to be launched. Let's just say that I ordered the car by simply looking at the catalog. I've owned it now for two months and simply love it. Admittedly it does not have that sporty BMW feel but it comes pretty close whilst still maintaining that luxury feel. It's a car that I can enjoy in my youth and old age. I think Merc got it just right. Many people will argue that the car competes with the BWM 3 and comes close yet fails. I say that the C is in a Class of its own. The C Class feels just right and offers the same level of enjoyment no matter what your age is. You simply cannot outgrow it. For the record: This car is not available in the US and some other countries. It's powered by a 2 litre with a Supercharger that develops performance comparable to the C240. Also Avantgarde is what Merc calls the Sport versions here.
