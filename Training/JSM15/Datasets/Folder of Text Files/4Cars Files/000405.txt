I think this car is a great reliable and very safe car. The '94 C220 was a replacement for the E190 and is a much better car and design replacement. It could use a 5 speed instead of a 4 speed but I'm happy with the 4 speed. No major problems. Pick up is good. I like the sound of the engine when pushing the accelerator down. Impresses my friends for a 17 year old with a MB. I would recommend any MB products for anyone looking for a safe reliable and up to date technology car. It's name says it all.
