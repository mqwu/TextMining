I have the wagon and highly recommend it. It's very easy to drive at high speeds on the straightaways my license is currenZy restricted for exceeding 100mph. The wagon has a self-adjusting leveling system for the rear-end that no longer works however I have not serviced the car in a long time and it has over 160k miles.
