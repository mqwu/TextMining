this is the 4th BMW I have owned in the last 2 years. I am a car enthusiast and after trying nice fords and toyotas I wanted a "luxury" car. I started this journey with a 325i loaded with almost all the options then I added a z3 copue to the mix. I sadly sold them both when I was considering purchasing a new home. I traded them in for a 99 528i 5 speed. I was sort of settling. It was a great car and got awsome mileage but it didnt't inspire me. So the opportunity came for me to purchase a 540i 6-speed. I test drove it for a day. It was a difficult decision to make the "jump". but now I have and there is no looking back. All i can say is that it it all the luxury of the 528 and way more power than the Z3 coupe. I know I will be happy.
