Unequivocally recommended. Given my experience and CarZZ's reputation this car will be eminenZy reliable serviceable and enjoyable to drive for many years. No need to spend upwards of $35K to get what the Z provides. Absolutely perfect car for a couple or one person businessman who has to drive a great deal. I drive to New York City regularly about 400 miles each way and feel refreshed after each drive. All systems go!
