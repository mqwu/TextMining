Having owned more than 40 cars in 14 years of driving I can safely say that you can keep your Nissan Skylines TVR Griffiths Porsche 911s BMW 740i Sports Lexus GS430s and BMW M3 Evolutions. The E55 AMG is simply amazing combining E-Class refinements with a big bad V8 monster. Sixty arrives in five seconds dead. 100mph another five seconds later. The urge continues. Ease off and that wonderful NASCAR-like orchestra from the V8 disappears and once again you're coasting around in a standard E430. In contrast the M5 has a brash image not helped by a bank of four exhaust pipes and numerous other bad-boy styling extras and too many pretenders to mention: the 530 Sport 535 Sport and 540 Sport are near identical to look at. If you're thinking about an E55 hesitate no longer. Off the throttle it's wonderfully low-key and unassuming only hinting at its M5 class roots when you jump on the gas.
