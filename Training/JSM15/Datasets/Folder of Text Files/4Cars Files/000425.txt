My car is always in the shop! Let's see is it the various lights brake and headlights that have gone out about 10 times the two radiators that have been replaced the broken cupholders the currenZy broken back window mechanism (even though in 5 years it's rarely raised and lowered) or the thermastat and tie arems ... that frustrate me.   Yes it's a fun car to drive and yes I've been the only owner and take it in routinely for maintenance but enough is enough. Consumer reports listed electrical problems very high for this year and decreasing in problems with every year thereafter.   I'd like to give BMW the benefit of the doubt and even bought an X-5 2000 model for the wife. Let's see died when going less than 10 MPH - they took out and reprogrammed the car's computer - a national problem the paint on the bumper chipped off the paint on the internal door handle flaked off too the gas tank has been replaced as well as fuel lines and the brakes now make the stearing wheel vibrate when braking from 70mph or above.    So do I just have bad luck? Well my partner has a 330 and has had three tires Continental blow out spontaineously on him! Causing a wreck the last time. Wouldn't there be a lot of lawyers now after reading this huh?    Well maybe I'll go Lexus Audi or Infiniti? I know I'll miss the feel but not the inconveniences!!!
