My comments concern the octane grade of gasoline to be used in my 2002 ES300. As I shopped for a new Lexus I was told by no less than 2 dealers that regular grade gasoline can be used. I was trading in a Cadillac with a Northstar engine and was happy to know I could get away from the premium pump if I bought a new Lexus. Then after purchasing I started reading my owner's manual and lo and behold it recommends 91 octane or higher. So I called my salesman explaining that it was the first fill-up since driving out of the showroom. He said "Oh use 89 octane. That's what we recommend!"     So now I have taken my car in for the first 1000-mile check-up (which happens to be at yet a 3rd dealer) and the technician servicing my car tells me he notices I have used the wrong lower octane gas. The technician explained the high performance engine in my Lexus requires 91 or even 93 octane in order to perform properly. While waiting for the 1000-mile check-up I walk into that dealer's showroom and ask the same question "What grade gasoline can be used in these cars?" The salesman again says "We recommend 89 octane." That's when I tell the salesman what the manual says and what his technicians out in the repair bays are telling us. He is shocked.    Apparently I have been duped along with everyone else that buys a new ES300. Premium gas is required and recommended by the manufacturer but the dealers in the showrooms are lying to the customers and not telling them.
