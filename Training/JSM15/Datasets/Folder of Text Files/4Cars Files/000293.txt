This is the ideal car for both in-town and highway travelling. It combines economy in terms of fuel usage plus the sufficient joy of the road to satisfy any driver. The ride is smooth there is little noise nor harshness in the ride. It is agile and quick enough for most drivers. If you desire a faster vehicle then you simply choose the C320 as opposed to this model. It deserves a best in its class award.
