I shopped my but off look for that great deal and I got it! I guess it helps to be in sells. I got the car with leather 6 speed sun roof fully loaded. The only thang I did not get with it was the 17 inch rims. But at $25000 out the door including taxes and everything is pretty good. The car is great I luv it!!!!!!
