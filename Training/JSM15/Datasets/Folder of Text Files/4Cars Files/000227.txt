I couldn't be happier with the ride fit and finish on this car. It has proven to be extremely reliable very smooth and best of all a real looker. I think it is better looking than the BMW 5's and Mercedes E's yet not as pretentious - it is classy without being overstated. The interior is very classy but I would recommend the wood-trim steering wheel and shifter knob if they are available to dress it up some more. The exterior finish is excellent which you can see when you park next to a lesser priced car of the same color. The GS300 is underpowered but it's on par with its competitors base engines. If you can afford it I would definately go with the GS400. That was my biggest mistake and if I could go back I would get the V8. Over all that the best thing about this car is the dealership - I've never been treated so well at a car dealer. From the initial purchase which consisted of very minimal haggling and "sales techniques" to the service center these dealers are extremely oriented toward the long-term satisfaction of their customers. You can tell they want repeat business. They provide free car washes any weekday and they dont't try to "sell up" when I bring my car in for a warrantee or other issues. They have free coffee snacks sandwiches and soda in the waiting room which also happens to have a TV stereo and VCR. I would definately buy this car again if I were looking for a mid-size sport-luxury car.
