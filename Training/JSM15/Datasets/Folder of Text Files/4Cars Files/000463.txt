everything about this car is wonderful. i think if you are willing to pay $30000+ on a car. it should be a Lexus ES 300. its worth the price you pay for it......and if you ever take your car into the dealer and they'll need to keep it overnight. they'll even give you a Lexus Loaners Car to use.....now how good is that?
