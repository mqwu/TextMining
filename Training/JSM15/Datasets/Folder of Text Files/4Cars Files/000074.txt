This car drives like a dream! It's the first luxury sedan I've purchased and I’d do it all over again with another Lexus. The Pearl White paint is an eye catcher by itself but the Platinum Series Rims encourages a second look from fellow Lexus Owners also! The interior ergonomics are impeccably designed from the back-lit (auto-intensity adjusting) instrumentation to the large push-buttoned controls (for driving gloved/clad fingers) on the Premium Sound System.    In two words: “Nice Car”
