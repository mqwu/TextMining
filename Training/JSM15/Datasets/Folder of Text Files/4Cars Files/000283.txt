I found the car a very refined presentation in or out. You can expect every single bit of tranditional Lexus workmanship on the car. The car offers alot of gadgets such as auto light control dual heated seats windows controlled by your key etc. that makes it a fun car to drive. Power is good and the car has great visibility. The only real weakness I found with the car is that the interior is very small. The headroom is bad especially if you have a moonroof.
