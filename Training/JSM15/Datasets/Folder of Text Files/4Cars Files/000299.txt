If this car is half as good as everyone says it is it will be phenominal. I've ridden in the E320 which was quite nice. I expect my MB to be the envy of the neighborhood when I get it next year. If I dont't like it some schmoe will pay me top dollar for not having to wait a year! Supply and demand I love it! 5 stars for value only because of the resale value. With taxes and registration my car is almost $66000 and I didnt't even get the phone (K4 package and fancy seats the only 2 options). Holy crap! $1000 for fancy headlights and wipers?? Also paid MSRP which I have NEVER donte in my life. Used to paying invoice or a tad over! I ordered mine on 10/31. Have to wait to next summer to drive. Sigh...
