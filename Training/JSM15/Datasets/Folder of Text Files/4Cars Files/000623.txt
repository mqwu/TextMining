Soul. The car has got great soul. If you want a all around good 4-door not too big not too small fast off the line good passing good handling steady safe feeling. Comfortable nice looking buy the 540 Auto Sport. It’s a great car. I’m a serious car fanatic with good consumer knowledge of cars. The 6-speed is just a pain for city driving.     It has this sort of character. It’s a heavy car that feels nimble it’s feels safe but yet very fast. It breaks well and handles well. It’s easy to park and has good visibility. The creature features are plentiful but hidden. The phone is easy to use and everything is controlled from the steering wheel. The car breaks nicely and can almost sense the safety of the thing when I’m driving in the city. If somebody hit me I’d be okay. If you’ve ever been in an accident you know what I mean. The lights sort of glow on and off with grace and the sports seats fit like glove. The M steering wheel feels very nice. It’s worth every penny.     I looked at many cars. 3-Series 540 Six-speed M5 7-Series X5 911 MB CarZZ Type-S Lexus 430 AUDI CarZZ MDX but this car gave me what I wanted. Good looks good performance and a thrill to drive.     SUV? What’s the point? Unless I had a family or wanted some off-road action or even wanted to tow a boat? But if I did I certainly would use a 60K SUV to do either. Plus they use more gas.     The X5 and 5-Series have the same price points... Does that mean you get free all-wheel drive?? I wish the X5 is made in the USA 5-series is built in Germany. The 5-Series has much nicer fit and finish. Better reliability too. Check it out and you'll see I'm right. Nothing is for free Especially from BMW.
