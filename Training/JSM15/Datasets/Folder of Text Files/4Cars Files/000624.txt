Well I have to say that this car has been an excellent vehicle. It has never braught me any kind of problems or have spent more than oil change money on it.  I have to say that the power it has is amazing although when the RPM reaches 4000 it kind of losses power. No big deal unless you like to race the thing.  I always burn just about any other SUV that approches me I have raced a stock civicsentra and I made them feel very bad...I have kept up to a maxima which I was surprized!!!!  But I have to say that this SUV is excellent it also looks very good and with the new rims that I got well it is even better.   I have driven many other SUV's and I really like this one the only suv that I would take over this one is the CarZZ MDX and the Lexus RX300!!!
