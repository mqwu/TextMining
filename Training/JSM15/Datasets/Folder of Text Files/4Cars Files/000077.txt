I have driven this car daily for the last 19 months. This car is a great commuter car. This car has good performance and above average handling. This car should be reliable and give you trouble free service upto and beyond the 100k miles range. However I am not fond of the front end styling because is creates no distinguished/sylish look. The hood should be less steep and have more chiseled lines. Fog lights also would have complemented the look of this car. The factory wheels could be changed to look bolder. This car was not designed to turn heads...it was designed to attact former Accord/Camry/Taurus owners with a bit more upscale version of the aforementioned vehicles without having to shell out $10-15k extra to get into the BMW525i/Lexus GS. If you want "sexy" look into Acua NSX or Porsche 911. If you want a good dependable easy to maintain vehicle for fair value TL will more than meet your needs.
