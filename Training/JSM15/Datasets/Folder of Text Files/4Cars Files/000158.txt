I to have had some massive transmission problems as stated in the above articals. I also had my transmission fail (twice)at 65 to 70 mph on the 5 freeway my only luck was that the cars/trucks behind me were able to avoid hitting me. Cerritos CarZZ removed and replaced the transmission (no questions asked) back around mid. July. Now 1000   miles later and again the same problem. No warning just alittle slipping and higher revs from the stop than the ESC light  Check Engine light and also the 5th gear light started to blink. This all happened within one or two minutes as I entered the freeway. Just as soon I hit the passing gear all HELL broke loose. The car is back at Cerritos CarZZ for third new transmission.  This transmission design must be addressed before anyone dies. I'm not one to complain about much but this car scares me and my love ones. WE NEED HELP
