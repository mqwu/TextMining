I bought the car for 3 months now and I am totally satisfied so far. With the 6-speed manual version it is a really fun car to drive with great responsiveness and handling. It is one of the most powerful car on the market that is environmental friendly. It has ultra low emission labelling with fairly good fuel economy in city and excellent on highway. I almost got the BMW330coupe which is an even better drive but my family thought it is not as comfortable as passengers and the backseat is even tighter than this hatchback and the fully loaded version cost $10000 more. I am also aware that the Japanese cars are much more reliable but no matter how pricy they get they just dont't attract as much attention and envy as the German cars.
