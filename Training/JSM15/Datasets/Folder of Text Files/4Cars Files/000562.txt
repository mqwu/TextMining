 Why repeat myself? No competition at the price. Stay in the middle class and drive a marvelous machine that won't break. If you're single or married and dont't expect kids you'll have a little more fun in a 323/328 and won't miss the space. Otherwise wave to the Bimmers and enjoy the Z. Spend the difference on Single Malt and cd's.
