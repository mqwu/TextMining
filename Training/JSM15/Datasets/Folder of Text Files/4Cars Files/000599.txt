We've only had our new 2003 for a month now but it's been sublime! This car was not built nor manufactured it was DESIGNED and ENGINEERED! Upon reading the manual I learned there was a little hidden drawer for coins and sundry objects on the left side of the cockpit (yes it feels like a Lear jet). When I found this little box and activated it I was surprised that it slid out perfecZy on some kind of spring actuated hydraulic feeling mechanism! I was once more stunned when I brushed my finger on the bottom of the little drawer! They had gone to the trouble of lining it with velvet velour! From this minor accessory example you can easily extrapolate what care and thought went into the primary and secondary systems of this Automotive Masterpiece!
