Stereo Update: Regarding my initial post I would like to clarify my comments on the Bose Stereo system. I did not articulate my thoughts correcZy.    I have discovered that the bass and treble levels have plus and minus indications on the LCD readout. I did not take this into account in first report.    Again I think the system sounds just fine. However I have the bass set near the middle position and the treble nearly maximized to get what I perceive as the best sound.
