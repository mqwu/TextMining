I would recommend the BMW for those who have the patience and time to deal with multiple service calls. I believe BMW has a good product but they should focus in those functional areas of the car requiring frequent service calls. Their stockholders and customers would profit from a more reliable product. The only department that would loose is their service department who in 5 more months when my car runs out of warranty will start charging me $80 per hour. Two months ago when I bought this car (used) I thought I wanted BMW to take me to a new level in driving experience. Now that I'm half way there after frequent service calls I'm ready to go back to the hassle free experience of owning an Asian product.
