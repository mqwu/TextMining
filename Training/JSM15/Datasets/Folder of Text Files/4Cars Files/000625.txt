BMW wasn't kidding around with their slogan "The Ultimate Driving Machine". This 6spd 2 ton monster can haul butt from 0-60 5.8 sec. You get compliments from both men and women (beware of gold diggers and leeches). This Sedan gets my two thumbs up on performance over-all and luxury. 99-todays 540 Sports are equipped with M Steering Technology (super feel when changing lanes and cornering from highway patrol). As soon as you get behind the wheel to go to work or just out for a cruise you transform into a speed racer. Even if you were never a fast driver before. This BMW feels like your driving 40 when in actuality you're doing 80+ MPH (like most BMW's). Make sure you have warranty tune-up's range from $400-700 (That's expensive as it is).
