The more I drive this car the more I fall in love with it. The perfect mix of power design quality and luxury. I got 17" Italian rims on it (245/45x17-front 255/40x17-back) so now it looks even more amazing. I get people turning heads all the time- I never thought nor intended this but there you go. It is the little details millions of them that make you love this car! Genuinly driver's car!
