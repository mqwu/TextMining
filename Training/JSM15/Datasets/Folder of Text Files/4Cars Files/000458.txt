According to Car&Driver mag this car takes 208ft to stop from 70MPH to 0. This number is worse than most new Cars And Trucks you can buy on market. What a pity for an otherwise great car. It sure has enough horse power to go fast but way too weak brake system. Honda should learn something from BMW which always try to match horse power with brake power. Another drawback is they dont't bother to put side-impact protection beams on the two rear doors (I could be wrong on this)!!! Family value???
