What a great car! Superb fit and finish decent power and handling perfecZy layed out interior with just the right blend of luxury and functionality and (most importanZy) very quiet while in motion.     2001 was the last year before the redesign that you see heavily advertised on TV these days. I prefer my 2001 even though there are more advanced features available on the 2002.    The ES300 for 2001 was loosely based on the Toyota Camry; at the same time there are noticable differences between the 2001 ES300 and the 2001 Toyota Camry (e.g. Lexus has frameless windows and the Camry has framed windows; the lines of the two cars are markedly different). The 2002 ES300 and Camry are practically identical in appearance.
