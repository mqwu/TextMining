I have never loved any object so much in my entire life! This car is not only an absolute pleasure to drive it has also been a lifesaver (because of its brakes handling and suspension). As someone who loves to drive up steep and winding roads this is the perfect car for the job. It is quick responsive and stops on a dime. I couldn't recommend this car more highly.
