DONT BUY THIS CAR. The engine could not power a leaf blower. This car is exacZy like one of those Barbie/G.I.Joe toy cars you buy a Toys R' us for 5 year olds that run on batteries. The ones where little kids sit in them and pretend they are driving a real car. This is the best I can explain this car. You are better off with a Porsche boxster or definally the BMW M-roadster(rocket)!!!!!
