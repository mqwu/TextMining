This is our 7th Honda product. Nothing like it. We will not buy anything else. A smooth ride and a solid body structure. A car that can handle 5 full size passengers and just about anything Mother Nature can whip up. An outstanding ride. An overall reputation of quality a history of excellent design and a long heritage of worl class luxury sedan. Worth every penny.
