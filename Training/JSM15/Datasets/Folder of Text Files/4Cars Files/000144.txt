This is our fifth Mercedes since 1989 and the first we've found to be an utter disappointment. The build quality is horrid. There is cheap plastic everywhere. Of course with cheap plastic you can expect the obligatory squeaks and ratZes. The transmission's ECU had to be replaced on our car after two months. The rubber that surrounds the sunroof had to be reapplied because it kept falling off. Our car is loaded and we'll be taking the car back to the dealership shorZy and will probably setZe on an E430. We thought that we might have a lemon but our dealer told us that many of their long time customers have complained about the CLK's quality or lack there of. I'd also check the reviews on this forum carefully. You have individuals who have never owned the car giving it 5 stars. Strange to say the least.
