I had this car as a company car in Germany for almost 1.5 years and put about 30000 miles on it during this time under all possible weather and road conditions. Although it was only the 2 liter engine without the compressor (136hp) which has never been sold in the US this car was lots of fun. Fast (it gets easily upto 130 mph) fuel efficient and great convertible with the foldable roof. With the heated seats and the strong heating it makes lots of fun in the winter when driving with the open top. Especailly when it is snowing. I loved it. If you want attraction wait for the winter open the roof and drive around in the snow. The people will stare at you...
