What a wonderful car!     I took a long time looking for a replacement for my VW Passat and test drove a lot of cars. 5 mins behind the wheel of the 530 and I was hooked. The car felt as if it had been built around me and seemed to know ahead of time what I wanted it to do. Finally understood all of the rave reviews I'd read in auto magazines.    Assembly inside and out is impeccable the design is elegant and understated the engine is a jewel and the car has the best balance of ride and handling available. As one auto magazine said "the 5 series is the Tiger Woods of sports sedans".
