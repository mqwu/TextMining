My CarZZ Z-S is terrific. There is not a squeak or a creek anywhere - despite the rather stiff suspension. As to suspension it is not as stiff as I have heard some critics say it was. Actually it is jsut what I would have expected from a car that is reported to handle as the Z-S does. The engine and the transmission work beatifully together. The engine is powerful and has a lot of torque. The 5 speed automatic transmission is geared very nicely and shifts almost as though it knows what you are thinking. I have heard a number of complaints about the Bose Stereo system. However I have adjusted the base to the low end of the spectrum and have maximized (almost) the treble. The stereo sounds terrific in my opinion. The stereo does however sound badly with the bass at the high end and the treble at the low end. This car is a sweatheart!
