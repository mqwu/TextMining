Ok well I think that LEXUS Should really get over there style on this ES300 I mean what's up with the same style for 5 years? Come on I think they could put a sportier look on this car to aZeast go head to head with the CarZZ Z i mean 200hp to 210? Thats the big deal? No! This car should aZeast have 230 or 240 hp and this car needs a huge boost on its engine and they should stick with the front wheel drive but overall i think the car is really good i mean i know many owners who had there ES300 for years and theres this one guy who has a 1997 ES300 with 110000 miles i mean this car is good for that but for 2003 they need a new face lift and MORE i mean MORE HP!!! And a bigger engine...
