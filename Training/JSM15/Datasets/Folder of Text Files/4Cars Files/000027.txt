I was looking for a car that could go fast and have a removable top. Well this car does all. Just to beat the Mustangs and Camaros off the line puts a smile on my face. But it makes the people with mullets very upset. I did break the sway bar spring within a month from hitting a curve way too hard but other than that no problems.
