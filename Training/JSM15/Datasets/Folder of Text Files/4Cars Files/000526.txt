I paid $24000 for my 1996 RL with 23000 miles on it(not even broken in)and in that price I also recieved the 7year/100000miles bumber to bumber warrenty. I woould have liked to have gotten the premium package which includes heated seats and mirrors traction control more woodgrain and a CD changer(which the previous owner had installed anyway). This is a great car BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!
