There were several little problems with this car that had me in the dealership time and time again. The fabled MB service is a bit overhyped. The MB dealer rarely gives a loaner car or provides rental and ordering parts is mystifyingly slow. A second vehicle is an absolute must in the city. If not you will suffer inexplicable scrapes and dings which will cost you. When this car is good its great to have. There are an annoying number of minor things that demonstrate lack of quality and craftsmanship. My glovebox latch broke and wouldn't close. The cupholder stuck. The gear shift dust cover broke. Lots of cheap plastic parts. Lots of cheap plastic problems. Overall my CLK 320 is like a beautiful woman. She's sexy and turns a lot of heads but is very fickle and expensive to maintain. She is not particularly fond of going out in the snow or rain. Everybody wants her because of her looks but when you have her you wonder if she's worth all of extra hassle. Premium gas premium parts premium accessories. But when the sun is shining and I'm rolling on the highway I am feeling lucky to have her. They say "if you want to be for the rest of your life happy never make a pretty woman your wife". In this case if you do you'll definitely need a more reliable mistress because your wife will be at her parents house (the dealership) a whole heck of a lot! The CLK is more a reflection of style than of function and reliability. Its not the best sports coupe but it looks the best in its price range and has the Mercedes emblem. That's mainly what you pay for. If your looking for quality...look elsewhere.
