After 25000 miles I am still in love with the Z. The car has yet to pay a visit to the shop. I also feel very safe in this car especially after seeing how it held up in a major accident. I was recenZy rear ended at high speed by a mid-sized Nissan. Given the power of the impact I had expected the entire rear end to be caved in. To my surpise there was virtually no damage. (A few scraches which were later removed with car polish.) The front end of the Nissan was a mess and I later learned that the car had been totaled. This car is built like a tank and it screams quality in every respect.
