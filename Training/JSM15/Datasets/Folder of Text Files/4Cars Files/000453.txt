This car is outstanding. There's a certain harmony that comes from all the gadgets on board. When you push a button or move a lever its quiet and soft.Even the steering is silky smooth. Mine is black with black leather and chrome wheels quite a looker. I bought it used with 28000 miles and it now has almost 65000 miles (3 yrs later). It is still as solid as the day I bought it. I've tested the Lexus LS400 and MB E320 and each car has its strengths and weaknesses however overall in terms of value the Legend is quite a package. Reliability fun value and great looks. Even though the Legend was discontinued 6 yrs ago it still looks great. It has always stood out in a crowd and 6 yrs later it still does. My problems with the car have been few. A power antannae and steering adjustment switches all replaced under warranty. Also once in a great while a power door lock won't work but this happens 1 time out of 100. At the time of purchase I opted to have an alarm installed big mistake they installed a Karr alarm system. This has to be the biggest pc of junk ever. First of all the button on the key fob is raised above the surface of the fob itself so that when I put it in my pocket I would always either unknowingly unlock the car or activate the panic alarm which would take me at least 15 seconds to deactivate. Secondly the key fob had a second button for my trunk release which I have to hold down for at least 5 seconds and this button is also raised. Don't get a "Karr". Anyway I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking for a reliable used luxury car who has about $15000
