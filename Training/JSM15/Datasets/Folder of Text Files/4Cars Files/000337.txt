First impressions VERY smooth ride. Suspension is a little too soft. Interior has good spec. Mileage is 69000 and is like new. ONE MAJOR PROBLEM is the automatic gear shift. From 1-2 you hear a jerk as it changes up. SlighZy jerky and not very smooth either. I had a Lexus GS300 1995 before this and the Honda doesnt't even come NEAR it. I will be selling this car after only 2 days (Yes I bought it yesterday!) and will be buying a New LEXUS GS300 SE next week.
