I paid 18000 for it. It was an unbelievabley cheap price. It has very low miles mint condition. It is the most comfortable car I have ever driven in. The stereo is the best stereo system i have ever heard. It is so clean sounding and powerful when necessary. I would give it more than 5 Stars. ****** Stars
