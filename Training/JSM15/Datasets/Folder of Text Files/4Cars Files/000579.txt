I just got my ES300 for a 17th birthday gift and I love it. I dont't know the car totally well yet so I can't really give a fair judgement but as of now it's an incredible car to drive at least compared to what I was driving before which was one of my parent's Lincoln Town Cars. It's very fun to drive on short trips and around the city but it wouldn't be my first chioce on long trips(100 miles or more)..
