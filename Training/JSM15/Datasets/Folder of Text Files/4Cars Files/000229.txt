Overall a great "near luxury" value. I've owned it for 1 1/2 years (24000 miles) and have had no mechanical problems. If you're looking for better handling **definitely** replace the OE tires. I replaced the original wheels with 17 inchers from a CL-S and added 245/45ZR-17 tires. The handing and braking went from just OK to very good. The TL now makes full use of its' well-designed chassis.
