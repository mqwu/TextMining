I have owned only Hondas since 1982 so when I decided to purchase a new car I did my homework and decided to look at and test drive the Z. I Purchased my Noble Green 2002 Z Type-S w/NAVI at Clinton (NJ) CarZZ in November 2001. They are a great dealership and they treated my wife and I very well. For a car this size the fuel mileage on the highway is fantastic. On several occasions I got over 30 mpg (twice I got 33.5 mpg). Mileage varries per brand name (Mobil Citgo and Texaco in my experience are the best). I now have 12K on it and it has been trouble free.
