I went to buy a new 2000 E430 I drove in three ocasions: twice in dealers and the other one my friend's car. My conclusion the E430 has a little bit more of lower rpms torque but the E420's engines is much much more smooth and you feel that the car is faster(not a lot faster). All E430's from 98 on had their steering box changed for the US people thought it was "heavy". For me the E430 steering felt just like an Expedition. I have a friend that works in Mercedes-Benz in Germany he told me that the 4.2 liter was replaced for the 4.3 with the only objective of lowering their cost. The 4.2 engine is an expensive engine it has 4 valves per cilynder and double overhead camshaft. The 4.3 engine is the same block as the 6 and 12 cilinder.
