I'm very concerned with the wind problem. It's great on a calm day. I'm persuing the problem at the moment. I dont't think the car has ever been damaged so I'm confused about the possible cause of the instability. It's difficult owning an entry level model and expecting to get good service. I get treated a bit like a 2nd class customer. I guess I shoulda bought an "S" class........maybe my problem would be solved by now.
