My first MB. I love the car. It has run very well for me. Good acceleration/braking/ride/handling. I got mine with the C2 and C3 packages along with the CD changer. I was terrified at first to drive such an expensive car but now I really enjoy my time behind the wheel. It won't bowl anyone over with 0-60 times but it has plenty of power for every day driving situations. I am disappointed that the car gets such poor mileage on the required premium gas.
