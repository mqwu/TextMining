This car is euphoric to drive probably because I like going fast. The 6 speed with 280+ horsepower is awesome. Handling is very good (came with 17" wheels) but I intend to stiffen the suspension at some point. The interior of the car is luxurious but not overbearing. After owning several American and Japanese cars I was amazed at the design and engineering of this vehicle; hardly anything is forgotten - except cupholders but who should be drinking at 130mph? (The speed is limited for American models; European models are not with a top speed of 155+) Happy motoring!
