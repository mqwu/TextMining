I've owned this car for over two years and I really like driving it. It has plenty of power and the handling is outstanding. Mine has a six-speed manual. It is a little rough from 1st to 2nd gear but pass that point it is no problem. Note that the AMG version is called SLK 32 AMG not SLK 320 AMG. One reviewer is complaining about SLK 320 AMG which does not exist. In my opinion you should probably not trust the words of those who dont't know what he/she bought.
