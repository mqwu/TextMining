BMW has overrated reviews overrated comment. I think BMW has more problems than Merc. many electric problem. weak engine. too many small (useless) options even like interior lights. so I ended up buying the car with high proce because of some options like sport package and premium package(I think BMW can combine those two options into one option). the bimmer is pretty good but I was expecting much more than what I paid for because of those overrated reviews from car magazine(at least two bmw cars always end up top ten cars of the year). Even though my merc is over 5 years I rather drive my merc. I am sure I have to sell that merc pertty soon but I rather buy another merc than bmw.
