I looked at the Z 1999 and liked it. I however purchased a maxima SE and had nothing but trouble with electrical failures.When the Maxima had 19000 miles on it...GOODBY..and Hello 2001 Z. I would call this car near luxury ...def not luxury. It is very comfortable has plenty of power and gets up to 27.5 MPG on the highway at high cruising speeds. The handling is adequate although it does handle like a sedan with the 16 " tires. The stereo does not compare to my Maxima Bose system and I do miss that booming base. However it is not horrible either. The radio reception leaves something to be desired..problems that CarZZ does not want to address. I had some seat noise (loose clip) and sunroof noise. Both were fixed under warranty. I feel this car will live up to the honda reputation and would love to see it with 200 thousand miles plus.     Like it so much my wife got a 2001 CL when her lease expired on her 98 CL.
