I would only recommend this car to real driving enthusiasts. When it works the car is peerless. Sadly it doesnt't work that often. Ownership of a $50K+ car should be without incident. Not with this car. As far as meeting my expectations it is the worst car I've ever owned. You'll have fun with it but ultimately it will cost you too much money and grief. I will not be buying another BMW. Ask yourself if you're really prepared for ownership of a 5-series. Are you willing to tolerate the electrical mechanical and quality glitches? If you are you'll have a thrill ride that is hard to beat in a 4 door car. If ultimate performance is NOT your primary concern..move on to something else. BTW my experience with BMW dealerships has been VERY unpleasant. Arrogance and ignorance combine to make for an unbelievably annoying experience.
