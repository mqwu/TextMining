This is a cute convertible. If you're not utterly and absolutely enamored with the retractable hardtop you should look elsewhere because the car isn't that special once you get past it. First off the car is somewhat slow or at least it feels slow and that because of the supercharged 4 cylinder. The engine just doesnt't sound right. It also causes reverberation in the interior of the car. I was hoping for a sports car when I bought my SLK but this car is a little too soft when entering corners quickly. The handling does not inspire confidence when driving hard. The brakes are very nice. The feel good and the grip is tenacious. The seats need a little more support when driving aggressively. I like the stereo. The reception is fine here in NY. I didnt't think a Mercedes was supposed to have squeaks and rattles. I guess that myth is shot to heck. I'd never buy another unless they drastically improve the car. When I sell this I'll probably consider a BMW 323 convertible or maybe I'll go with the Saab. After this experience I'll take a very long test drive with both cars. It's possible I have a bad example but doubtful. Make sure you extensively test drive this car before you buy or lease one. Good luck in your search!
