Overall a very nice car. The only reason I traded this car was the extreemly uncomfortable seats on long trips. Around town it was fine vacations were pure hell. It had a good ride and good handling. Adequate power and smooth transmission. For the money it's an ok value. If you travel alot.... think twice.
