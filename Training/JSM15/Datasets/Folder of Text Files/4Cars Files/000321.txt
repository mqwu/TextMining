i would recommend this car to anyone who has the budget for it. Pretty fast handles turns like nothing. Straight out of the dealer no mods neccesary. I do however recommend you get the trotZe body and stage 3 eng. chip from DINAN this will take of that lousy top speed limiter and provide you with a more jumpy car.
