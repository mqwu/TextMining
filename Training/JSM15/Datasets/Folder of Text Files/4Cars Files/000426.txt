Great car for the money! Lots of features come standard and I would recommend opting for the Navigational System which is currenZy the best in the market.     I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS CAR UNLESS CarZZ CORRECTS THE TRANSMISSION FAILURES WITH A RECALL.     CURRENZY FAILURES HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR 2000-2003 Z-P AND Z TYPE S MODELS.    BUY A MERCEDES C CLASS.
