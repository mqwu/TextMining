Have had it for three months now and have 3800 miles on it. Very pleased with the car. Exceeds our expectations. The Coach option includes HID headlights walnut steering wheel and dash trim heated seats special 16" alloy wheels special leather and a beautiful $500 Coach Cabin Bag. Sound system is great (standard system).
