I test drove many cars in the past year before making my selection. The ZS is the best value and sporty sedan with front wheel drive. The 330i was a tad better in handling and the engine was electric. However the CarZZ was on the bottom of the list until I drove the new 2002 ZS and I new that this car was the choice for me. I recommend anyone looking for a sport sedan to test drive this car before you buy.
