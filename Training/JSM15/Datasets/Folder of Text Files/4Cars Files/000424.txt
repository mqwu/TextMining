I have had nothing but problems with this car since the first week I got it. I bought the car brand new so I know everything was fine the day I bought it. I have also recieved bad service and treatment at my local Mercedes-Benz dealership. First off my sunroof stopped working in the middle of a rainstorm. The sunroof wouldn't close so I had to drive it to my dealership with an umbrella hanging through the sunroof. One day I was on the freeway and my engine started shaking and the car wouldn't go over 60 mph. My back brake light went out already! My gas gauge broke. I took it into the shop for all these problems they kept the car for 5 days. I got the car back and the sunroof still doesnt't work and the gas gauge is still broken. My brake assistant light keeps going on. When they had my car at the dealership they banged up the back bumper they tore one of my leather seats they tore the pannel in my passanger door and now my radio doesnt't go off when I turn the car off. What else could go wrong. Well I'm sick of this even though the car is beautiful it's a piece of junk and Mercedes won't do anything about it. I'm now going to buy a Cadillac Escalade hopefully they'll be more dependable.
