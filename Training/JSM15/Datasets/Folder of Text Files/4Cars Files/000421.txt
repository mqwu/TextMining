Car was in great shape..bought it from a doctor who didnttttt't really care about price (ie he sold it cheap). The beauty is the engine had been recalled (like most 93-94's) so it had fewer than 50000 miles on it. There are many out there..check it out A couple of grand (new driveshaft shocks tires) and it's like new.
