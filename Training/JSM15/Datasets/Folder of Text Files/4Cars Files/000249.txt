Absolutely solid as a rock. It still starts on the first turn of the key even in sub-zero tempatures. I have over 96000 miles on it and have only one complaint. The rotors on the brakes wore out at around 45000 miles. Admittedly that was 85% city driving. Other than that the car runs without a flaw. This is even after being sideswiped by a drunk and having $7500 worth of repairs donte. Periodically I think about a new car but then I think about how reliable my C220 has been and just smille.
