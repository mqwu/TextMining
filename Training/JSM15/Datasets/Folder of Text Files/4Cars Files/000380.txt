Overall unimpressive. The reliability was awful. I could not quite understand how a vehicle purportedly from a luxury marque could have such abysmal reliability. The seat belt anchor broke in my first *month* of driving it (from new!). I could not believe how much engine oil it consumed. It's air conditioning and heating broke down after about 90K kms. Serivce costs were absurd matched only by the condescending attitude at just about every dealer I tried. To say the least after enduring in for 5 years I ditched it and swore off BMW's for life. I shall stick with Infiniti and Lexus products which offer superior performance and way better value
