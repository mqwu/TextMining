We've had our CLK430 coupe for almost 4 months now. It replaces a 1995 Honda Accord we purchased new. Our car is black with charcoal interior with all options including phone and COMAND options. The 8 cylinder is a blast. It has a lot of torque and always ready to accelerate especially compared to the old Accord. The brakes are incredible. It's hard to imagine brakes getting much better than this. They never fade in regular highway driving. The handling is a bit soft. The car severely leans during hard cornering and it floats over bumps like my father's old Cadillac. I think this car uses the same suspension as the 6 cylinder version. That's too bad. The quality of this car disappoints. I didnt't think MB's rattled and squeaked so much. Our Honda never exhibited any rattles and rarely a squeak. However the dashboard and interior door panels release a cacophony of noise on each and every trip. Where's the quality? The COMAND looks pretty neat but is an ergonomic mess. I have a degree in computer science and this thing is a prime example of poor engineering. Next time we'll give Lexus or BMW a shot.
