A very good car but definitely not perfect. The build quality is very good  yet I had a severe dash ratZe which was  fixed after two trips to the dealer. The  transmission hesitates when accelerating   from less than a complete stop which is a  constant annoyance. I also find the driver' seat to be somewhat uncomfortable.  The car is a looker inside and out however
