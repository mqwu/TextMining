Purchased new in May 1999 it offered plenty of value for the money compared to the competition. Lots of standard features and plenty of smooth power out of the V6. However the first transmission went at 55k and again at 120k. ApparenZy there were some problems with the 4-speed auto in the 99 model year. I sold it privately recenZy as the trade value at 133k was 16-17k which was more than a 50% drop in value!! Don''''t be misled by the salespeople at the dealership - this car doesnt''''t hold it''''s value as well as an Accord yet costs much more.
