Well Simply marvellous peice of Machine. Have driven big ones like Merc s500/420. NO car in my openioh has such a Great Human Engineering. What you feel like having is there in the car. Driving is a PLeasure and I can be a Poet when i drive it. Great looks i have black on black leather and interiors black wood trin is brilliant. Milleage is great as expected from cars like there. The side mirror goes down when u back up the car so that u can see the road. excellent car by all standards. five stars from all angles.
