This car is expensive there's no doubt about that. Having said that I would pay a little more to get the enjoyment it will deliver. If you've had a bad day all you have to do is drive this car and the day gets better. The new engine is great smooth balanced power and it will really launch from speed if you want it to. The nicest car I've owned and I've had a few. Blows away the Audi in handling and driving pleasure. The Audi is a nice car with a little more HP but it will put you to sleep with its handling. I cant say enough about the looks of this car. It's beautiful. Inside and out. The new rims and headlights make it look like a touring car. Go get one!!
