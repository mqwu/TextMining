This car is beautiful. I opted for the black with oyster interior. The AMG ground effects and wheels complete the package.    The 4.3 liter engine is a wondefully smooth and powerful. You're not going to out accelerate any Corvettes or M3's but it's plenty quick and downright impressive when accelerating from 70mph-100mph.    The brakes are phenomenal. There is no fade from 90+mph to 60mph. And they feel great.    Unfortunately build quality and the quality of interior materials were not paramount to Mercedes when building this car. It's obvious Mercedes was on a cost cutting mission when they built this car. The interior is filled with cheap plastic and thin carpet.    The squeaks and rattles get very annoying. This IS a Mercedes not a Chevette.
