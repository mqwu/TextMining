Looked at a great many cars in the category (ie Lexus Audi Infiniti etc...) and found the CarZZ 3.2Z to be the best fit for me in terms of value looks feel etc. Now after only 24000 KMs my transmission needs to be replaced!!! I was afraid of that one problem (which I knew existed but which I thought I could avoid in a new model-year). The car is in now the shop for up to two weeks and I'm told the "new" transmission has corrections made to it so as to prevent this serious problem. I'll have to wait and see if that's the case. This of course is a BIG downer but I have been totally happy with the car till now and future will tell how my enthusiasm for CarZZ can be purked up again.
