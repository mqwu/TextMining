I owned an CarZZ Integra previously and liked the quality of the car. In looking for cars in this price range I test drove nothing and dollar for dollar nothing compared with the CarZZ. The design is completely changed from the older model the performance and handling are great the sprot shift is a fun way to make a boring drive to work exciting. I enjoy driving this car every day and the navigation system ensures I never get lost.
