The GS is the BEST car in the market. I love this car. I've had now for about a year. I wouldn't even think about trading this car. I love every SINGLE detail in this car. Engine and Transmissions are just Beautiful. I've driven BMW 528 and 540 Mercedes Benz E series and CarZZ. Lexus surpasses them all. The customer service is FIRST Rate. Road Side Assistance is Free 24/7. Dealers know how to fix ALL the problems and how to treat the customer with the utmost respect. On the road this car is just soo sporty and soo luxurious that everyone who takes a ride with me just says wow. I bought the car used with 70000 miles on it and drove it for 30000 and I have had ZERO problems. The car runs smoothly and all it asks for are just some oil changes along the way. I've had a friend who has driven his 98 GS300 for 250000 miles and had ZERO problems with it (just the usual few minor problems). inside this car it's a whole new world. The audi system is awesome with PLENTY of power. the Climate control unit is so awesome. If you are in the market looking for a car and can afford this car just get it. This is THE car.    P.S. I've tried both the GS400 and GS300. I didnt't feel any difference between them except a minor difference in acceleration. I chose the GS300 because it saves me some money on Gas and handles exactly the same as the 400 and 430 (although fuel economy statistics disagree). But a 6-cylinder definitely sucks less fuel than an 8-cylinder engine.
