I was very pleased with the way we were treated at our dealership and more that happy with the performance and quality of the BMW. The 525 has the smallest engine of the 5 Series but the performance is really fantastic. I just could not imagine driving the 540 or the M5. The 525 gets me where I want to go in style and with the least amount of effort. I would highly recommend this car to anyone.
