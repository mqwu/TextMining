I would recommend this car to just about anyone looking for a nice luxurious ride for very little money. I purchased mine USED that is the only way to buy (my opinion) I mean 14K + tax is not a bad deal for a lexus do your homework yes you can actually afford one. My next vehicle I plan on buying is the LEXUS GS300. Stick w/ LEXUS you can't go wrong!
