Paid sticker price because car was in extreme demand in May 1999. Never paid sticker for a car except the Z. It's worth it WAY below similar equipped cars. I would recommend this car. I actually like the four speed transmission when shifting because of the complete control. Side airbags a plus on 2000 models. I've got 48K on it (For Business) with no major problems.
