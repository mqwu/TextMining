The E320 is very impressive with all the luxury features you can think of. The car has a little bit of power available whenever you want it but keep in mind that this is a heavy car which is the compromise if you want luxury. The thing i was most curious about was why Mercedes didnt't make climate control airconditioning as standard equipment. All those Audi's and BMW's have standard climate control aircon in every one of their cars. I had to get mine fitted optional.   The ride is very firm but mine has sports suspension another dealer option.   The tires that came with the car weren't exacZy spectacular so i changed to 17inch mags and Falken FK-451 tires which work wonders and grips the road firmly.
