I disagree with other peoples opinion about the styling of the car being bland or not a head turner. I think the car is very elegant and I was attracted to it because of it's similarity in styling to the comparible Lexus and Mercedez models at a much better price. I am 6'-4" tall and fit in the car very comfortably and will have a very hard time going back to an Accord or Altima in the future.
