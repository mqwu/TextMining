This car compare to its class has almost all options.  Before I purchased the car I did my homework and found that  (with similar options) MBenz C320 MSRP $44000.00 (w/ better engine technology) BMW 330i MSRP $38500.00  Even Lexus doesnt't have the same engine & HP still more expensive.  Very satisfied with the car and highly recommend to all buyers.   Paid $31360.00 (w/ MUD GUARD & WHEEL LOCK)
