This is a very fine all around automobile. Wit the top up you have a very secure environment no cloth top or plastic rear window to worry about. The top-down motoring is incredibly fun. Certainly not a speed demon but in my three years of driving it I've never thought that I needed more - in other words it's plenty fast. Sure footed handling and stability at high speed. I've not had the sqeaking/rattling problem that others complain about. Perhaps my early production model had a bit higher quality control.
