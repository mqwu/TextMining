A love-hate relationship. This is our 2nd E39 540i. A great car but you'd better find its unique attributes worth the expense and trouble to be happy with it. Not a true luxury car since it's not cushy enough. Buy it for the handling not for the luxury or image or you'll be disappointed. We sold the first one then couldn't find anything we liked better after 6 months and bought this one!
