This car is fun to drive. The 4.3 liter V8 supplies tremendous performance efforZessly. The smoothness of the engine is noticed by everyone who drives it. On the highway it drives like a dream with the ability to accelerate from 80 to 110 (as fast as I have gone so far) with no problem. In fact at 100 it feels so solid you would think you were going 50. This car is well appointed with many features that aren't immediately apparent when you first get in. Mine is equiped with the NAV system which makes getting to unknown destinations a breeze. Independant temperature controls keeps you and your passenger comfortable. The large 17" wheels and high-performance low-profile Michelins combined with the AMG ground effects give this car a very agressive looking stance. Put the top down and the lines of this automobile are hard to beat. I also recommend the voice control system which lets you control the radio & CD changer as well as the integral telephone without taking your hands off the wheel. This is a great car with lots of power comfort and smile inducing performance.
