CarZZ Z S-type is everything you would expect it to be - fast (260 hp) reliable (nothing gone wrong in 6 months) stable (particularly at high speeds) comfortable (drivers seat at least) and affordable (best value in a luxury car). I also think it is a beautiful design although this is not shared by other reviewers (in the eyes of the beholder). The S-type is "hot" with teenagers as I found out from my 18 year old son (who is not allowed to drive it another story).
