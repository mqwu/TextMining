This car is really fun. Has enough power to be dangerous. The power top gets a lot of attention. Have had a lot of problems (weekly) with interior peeling. This started with the 2nd day of ownership. I was assured that this has never happened before. Mercedes has replaced interior 3 times. Said they will not do it again. The climate controls need to be improved. They take a while to begin. The cup holders are located in an akward place and drip down the center console. DO NOT BUY THIS CAR IF YOU DO NOT HAVE TIME TO TAKE IT IN FOR REPAIRS...WEEKLY!
