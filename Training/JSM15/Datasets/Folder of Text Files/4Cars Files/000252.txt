With the sport package and the xenon headlights this car looks as good as anything on the road. The sport package adds a great mesh front grille lowered bumpers and skirts and 17" AMG five star rims that add muscle and flare to this car. Without the Sport package this car seems timid and pettite just add those rims and everyone will back away! This car is fun because you can drive it with the wind in your hair or be less pronounced and just close her up. The 320 is very fast compared to the lesser Kompressor model its a different car with a different attitude. Very luxurious in terms of finish and comfort sport package is a must!!
