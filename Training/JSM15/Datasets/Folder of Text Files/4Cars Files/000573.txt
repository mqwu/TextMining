Maybe I am jinxing myself with this review but I love my 2002. First let me say this it is a luxury car NOT a sports. This car makes no pretensions about being fast sporty or being a babe magnet. It is comfortable car made for cruising.    This leads me to the transmission. It feels lazy becuase it is supposed to be. This may not be your cup of tea but it is designed for "sunday drivers" like myself. I dont't stomp on the gas but I can cruise comfortably and quitely at 85. I was very worried about he transmission problem too and test drove at least 10 300's seeking to recreat the pause. I was able to with effort but I never drive in that manner in real life. I have had need for sudden acceleration and it has not let me down. I picked this car becuase I am stuck in traffic 3 hours a day and I like the serenity of the interior.     As far as the interior there is nothing in this class that touches it. Period.    The one thing I will say about it is that it will not appeal to a large cross section of buyers. Again look at this car only if you want the most luxury 32 grand can buy. If you want a more "athletic" car get a G35 or 2004 TL. Or wait for the es330.
