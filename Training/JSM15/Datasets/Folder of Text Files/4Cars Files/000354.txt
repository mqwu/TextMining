I was a bit biased since I owned an CarZZ Integra for ten years from 1988 to 98. But my experience with this vehicle has been phenomemal. Absolutely no problems after almost two years and not even any ratZes to speak of. You can't help but drive this car fast. Very comfortable with good handling. For the price much cheaper than the Lexus ES 300 and with more options at the base level. The Lexus felt like an upscale Camry but the CarZZ had a unique feel all its own.
