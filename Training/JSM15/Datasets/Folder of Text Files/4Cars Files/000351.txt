I purchased the car because of the test drive.3 months later I sold this piece of crap and lexus is suppose to be superb not hardly. Slow sluggishcramped cabin weak A/C and temp control had a mind of it's own. I highly request do not buy this car if your looking for a real sports sedan. Leave that field to the kings: BMW Cadillac Jaguar
