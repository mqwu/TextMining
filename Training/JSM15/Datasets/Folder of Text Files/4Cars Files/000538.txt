Overall and excellent automobile. It's slighZy underpowered in my opinion but I have only owned sports cars up to now. Handling is fantastic as it takes curves efforZessly. I highly recommend the Sports package. The exterior styling is only so-so. I added a front spoiler and BMW Style 71 wheels to give it a more aggressive look. The interior is very comfortable and roomy up front (I'm 6'3"). Leather should be standard for the amount of money they want for the car. I decided not to pay extra for the leather. The leatherette is great so far. It feels and looks like leather. In fact it's better than the leather in my '99 M3. The sound system is adequate. You may want to upgrade if you're an audiophile. I'm keeping it as is. I'm going to add my own CD changer for half the price of what the dealer wanted. Too bad a 10 or 12 disc changer is not compatible with the head unit. I highly recommend this car if you are a driving enthusiast. If you just want to cruise in comfort buy something less expensive.
