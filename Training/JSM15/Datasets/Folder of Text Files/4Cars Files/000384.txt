I really do love my 2001 3.2Z. I was just totally disappointed when my transmission failed after only a 1.5 years of driving!!! After doing alot of research I found out that this is a regular occurance with many of the CL's and Z's of that year. Now I have a very sour opinion of ...which could easily be remedied if they would own up to the problem fix it and do a recall. But do you think they are doing that? Nope. I guess they are waiting for people to start dying from automobile accidents after their transmission failed. Thankfully I was going about 50 mph when mine failed and the car behind me was a safe distance away because when your wheels suddenly lock up at 50 mph you're giving the car behind you an open invitation to come right thru your trunk. For now they are replacing my transmission with a new one (of course with the same defect) so my concern is that the warranty will run out and my transmission will fail again!! I sure can't afford to replace my transmission and I shouldn't have to. All those who have had transmission problems or any problems log onto www.nhtsa.dot.gov/hoZine and submit a complaint to the Auto Saftey HoZine. Maybe once alot of people complain to NHTSA may be forced to fix the transmission...the other alternative is to take out a class action against the manufacturer...
