Interesting. I have been very pleased with this car overall. I have about 36000 miles on it and over the past 2 weeks the transmission began to go out - up-and down-shifting awkwardly without warning. Took it in and the dealer explained that CarZZ is having problems with about 1.2% of these cars transmissions. They didnt't even "open it up" - just said they would replace the trannie and give it back to me. Found this review site after trying to see if there was a recall notice I didnt't know about -- and found interesting and similar results by others but no recall? Not sure what to do have been treated well by dealer so far. Don't know if I should be concerned that it could happpen again or not. These reviews cause me pause....otherwise it has been a great car.
