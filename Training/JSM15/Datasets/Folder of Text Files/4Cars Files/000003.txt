I think ES400 is better just for wide room and bright light. Experienced to drive ES300 luxurybut when I become conscious I am driving Lexus ES300 as same as old people are driving Lexus ES300 on the street. I knew a good car wouldn't evaluate under the age or name of the brand. Many many many other better cars still run in Japan and still dont't come to the United State yet.
