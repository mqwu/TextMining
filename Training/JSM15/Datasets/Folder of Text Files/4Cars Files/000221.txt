I highly recommend this car. You can't beat the ride drive comfort quality build and outstanding customer service that comes with owning the LEXUS ES300. It'll kill the Mercedes C-class (2000 model and before) any day and in every aspect. I am sure the new redesigned 2002 Lexus ES300 will destroy the 2001 C-Class in terms of looks and technology -- when it comes out September 2001. The 2001 Infiniti I-30 is a good match but not good enough. BMW 3-series drive more sporty but the interiors are shaby dull and boring...and as soon as BMW redesigns their cars...they look old and dated. The LEXUS always look pretty fresh. I always get compliments from everybody old young and the ladies.....If I buy another entry luxury sedan.....I will buy another LEXUS ES300 over the competition - ANY DAY!!!!!!
