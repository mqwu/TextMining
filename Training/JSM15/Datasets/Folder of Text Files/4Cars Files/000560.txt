Bought it new. Now has over 81000 miles. Do a good mix of back roads even gravel roads and interstate driving from flat to mountainous terrain from crowded to very little traffic. Performance has been consistent and excellent. Mileage usually around 27 mpg when averaging about 75-80 mph. Cruise control keeps it very steady. Have had it at 130 mph without a groan and feeling like silk. Goes where it's pointed and stops when asked. ABS employed twice and worked as expected. As 95% of my driving is alone back seat is not an issue but when it was used passengers raved but they weren't over six feet tall either. I've had numerous 10-hour drives where I've been discomfited only by the length of the drive not by the car. Needless to say lesser drives are no problem at all; very comfortable. Service at James Motors Lexington KY excellent and D. Patrick in Evansville IN has been fine. FSS is a real plus. This particular model has a perciptibly different look due to the front air dam and lower side moulding which makes it appear more sporty. The fit and finish is excellent but can't avoid little stone chips following coal trucks. Not visible to anyone except me when washing it. Radio is a pleasant surprise when considering the antenna is in the bumper. Split rear seat has been handy a time or two. Automatic climate control works as expected and can be adjusted manually to suit needs. Single wiper works well in a deluge but the intermittent speed is a bit too lengthy between swipes. Rear windows go all the way down and the sunroof tilts slides and between the windows and the roof any combination of airflows can be donte if one doesnt't want to use the climate control. But the roof can be opened in February and the heat keeps a body warm.
