Impressive jeckel and hyde car. Its a race car and a sedan in one. Great Value all the goodies are standard without ordering individually and paying through the nose. Just watch out for the type-S ride though its so stiff your wife will refuse to ride in it with you and you'l end up having to go out in her crappy beat up Taurus when you are together!!!
