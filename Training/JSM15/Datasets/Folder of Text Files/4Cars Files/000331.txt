Thanks to everyone for your reviews. It was a close call between the TT and the SLK. The TT had only good reviews. The SLK ranged over the map. I opted for the SLK because of the hard top 6 speeds teleaid and ultimately the look. I picked it up today and have been grinning ever since. Its seems like MB has taken care of all of the short falls of the earlier models with the 2001 edition. The BOSE radio reception is good and the sound is excellent. Two bass speakers pick up the low end and mids and highs are great. The 230 uses a supercharger on a 4 cyclinder. The 2001 has 5 more horses than the earlier models from what I can tell. It gets up quick. I may not be the best judge of this because I've been driving a diesel for 15 years now! Anyway with 6 gears it turns about 2200 RPM and moves in the high 60s to 70s. Nice ratios and quiet at speed. The motor has a good sound even when pushed. Supposedly the car sits a bit lower with the 2001 than earlier models and the front air dam has been redesigned. Steering is precise and stable. It doesnt't use rack and pinion but has the typical MB feel. Solid! It goes where you point and is smooooth. The interior is ok and uses what room there is reasonably well. The TT has a bit more room when the rear seats are folded down. With the roof up the SLK has lots of trunk space for a sports car. The seats are comfortable. They could use adjustable lumbar. I've had back problems and the SLK seems easier to get in and out of than the others. Well summer is coming and I'll update after several months. I'll give it 4 stars for value because it ain't cheap. They could have thrown in the CD (at least a single disk version) and some seat warmers. Good driving!
