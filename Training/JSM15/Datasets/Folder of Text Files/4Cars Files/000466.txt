All I can say is "buyer beware" - not of the automobile itself because the car drives like a dream. The problem is parts and the problem is Audi. (Especially the ignorant and snobbish dealer network.) I've owned a couple of big cars all bought from the same guy - and this is by far and away the best car I've driven. It's slow and ponderous in the city but on the highway it truly shines. Built like a tank (with the average mpg to prove it...) this thing just gallops up to speed in no time. Safe extremely well built and....I'd say reliable but this is a 12 year old machine. When it's operating well you forget the problems...
