NICE NICE NICE NICE NICE NICE Very fast and nice. But... about 2 weeks after getting this sweet car I was confronted by a Benz E55 AMG took me in a race.. SO.... I have the car at my toyota dealer getting every TRD and L-Tuned part they could think of put on it. Including a Stillen Supercharger. We'll see what happens when I find that fella with the E55. I just put some 20" Lowenhart rims on it at they look GREAT.
