I traded my 98 Accord for the Z I sell Honda and I would tell customers that the Z was not worth the extra money. I thought I could be equally happy in an Accord. Now that I own a Z I am very glad I made this choice. Every part of the car is a little better when you add them all up it makes the Z a much better car than the accord. It seems like the sum of all the parts is greater than the whole. In also really like the capabilities of the Sport Shift. Sport Shift makes engine braking much better and gives me the ability to come out of corners much harder and makes the quarter mile much more fun. I did regret only having the four speed auto but after hearing all the potential problems with the five speeds I am glad to have it. One thing I do believe is that the transmission thing is being blown way out of proportion. It is a very limited number of cars affected and Honda extended the warranty on cars that weren't even in danger of having a problem so I am sure the ones that are affected are covered.
