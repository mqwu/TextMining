Most of the money you will spend goes into the engine about 4 thousand more than the 525. But in city traffic I think it's a waste of money. Heated seats are not standard this was the only car in stock with the convienence option. Would have liked the navigation system but again the car would have to have been custom ordered = 3 months. I suggest order the car to your specs so start shopping 3 months before you decide to get rid of your current car. This car is really fast if that is what you care about get it. Only major problem is rear wheel drive get snow tires or all season not sport tires. Consider the 3 series with all wheel drive if you live in a snowy area. The body has not changed since 1996 it's everywhere so people do not get jealous and scratch the car.
