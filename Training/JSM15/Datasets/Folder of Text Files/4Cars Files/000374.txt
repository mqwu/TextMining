The CarZZ Z is the best selling car in its class. In fact CarZZ has had one terrific sales year after another. There is only one reason for this and that is: BUILD QUALITY!! This is also the reason why IMPORTS in general are light years ahead of american cars!!    With that said the Z is SPACEOUS LUXURIOUS and has very good pick up!! When on the highway the interior is a tomb!! You dont't hear or feel anything going over all those bumps and you also forget the car has an engine because of the noiseless refined perfection called the 3.2liter sohc engine!! The car has excellent gas milage too! There is a button in this car for every concievable operation!! AUTO EVERYTHING PEOPLE!!     ON A SIDE NOTE:  I was looking at the infiniti G35 before I purchased my CarZZ. drawn in buy the tv ads I went to FEILD INFINITI of glenview IL. THESE PEOPLE WERE TOTAL JERKS!!! THEY IGNORED ME AND MY MOM AND SERVED OTHER CUSTOMERS FOR AN HOUR!! FINALLY I WAS FED UP AND WENT INTO A G35 ON DISPLAY AND STARTED TO PLAY AROUND WITH THE BUTTONS AND HONK THE HORN(TRYING TO BE OBNOXIOUS) THEN THE SALESMAN APPROACHED ME AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE CAR. THE WHOLE TIME THE SLIMEBALL ACTED LIKE I WAS TOO LOW CLASS TO EVEN BE IN HIS STUPID DEALERSHIP!! I LEFT FUSTRAITED AND INFURIATED!!  THEN I WENT TO MC GRATH CarZZ AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! THEY TREAT YOU LIKE A HUMAN BEING AND ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO LET YOU TEST DRIVE THE CARS OR PLAY WITH THE ONES ON DISPLAY TILL THE COWS COME HOME!! IF YOU WANT AN INFINITI GET ONE BUT DON'T GO TO FIELD INFINITI IN GLENVIEW ILLINOIS!! THEY ARE RETARDED
