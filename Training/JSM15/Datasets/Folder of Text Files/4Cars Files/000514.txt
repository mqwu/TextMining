Favorite part of the car is the beautiful dashboard. This is my second Lexus but it does not meet expectations. Weird design things like the ouZet for the cellphone buried way in the second layer console and no way to run the cord; side mirrors dont't adjust downward when reversing like the Bimmer5 (look out for those chrome wheels!!; needs net for trunk cannot keep items on that upper ledge. Lexus Service Dept is not what it used to be; two trips ago to pickup my car after leaving it all day they had lost my keys!!
