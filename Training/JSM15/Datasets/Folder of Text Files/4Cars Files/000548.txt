Great looking car particularly the aggressive looking Sport model. As fast as you'd want. Retractable hardtop that is the life of a party -- people just want to sit in the car raising and lowering the top. It's a wonderfully impracticle car (i.e. 2-seater no trunk space). My first MBZ and I'd consider other models in the future. The SLK is really only for someone who has another larger car for trips to the store golf course etc.
