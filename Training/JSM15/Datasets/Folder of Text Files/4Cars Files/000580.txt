No doubt this car gives you best value for the money in its class. Engine is lively and refined but it is no match with BMW 330i. If you want a true performance machine and have a deep packet you want to go for BMW 3-series. Interier layout such as door panel and instrument panel are too much alike Handa Accord only seat surface is leather.
