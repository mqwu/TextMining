This isnt your typical make believe sports sedan - like the Lexus IS300. This car is a beast. It competes in performance with some of the most powerful V-8s out there. It is faster than a twin turbocharged Audi S4 w/Steptronic. This level of performance was accomplished by making several modifications to the base TL engine by Honda Racing like titanium combustion chambers a higher compression ratio and adjusting the air intakes. Some of the technology was borrowed from the NSX. The handling is great for a car this long (193 inches!!!) considering the length of this car I would say that it handles on par with the BMW 330i which is a much shorter car. The previous reviewer is off his rockers. It is only common sense that the Type S version of the TL would be faster than the base TL. The base TL is also a fast car with a 0-60 time of 7.4 seconds...but the TLS makes a fast car even FASTER! Top speed of the TLS is 143 mph although there is no way to verify this..or is there?? :-) It does lack some of the panache that BMW Audi Lexus and Mercedes have but if you look beyond the snob-appeal this is the best sports sedan for the money. There are some things like the audio system styling etc. that could have been made better so I can only give it 4 stars overall.
