First the styling very clean nonintrusive and masculine shape thru out. This car is more of a conservative appearance with great fit amd finish. The V6 engine has the power of V8 with very sporty sound at full throtZe but otherwise virtually silent. Very well matched tranny the car accelerates better then expected and pulls strong all the way up to 140mph. Yes 140mph nice and calm too and the car is suprisingly tight and precise at high speeds. Otherwise the suspension is more on the soft side with moderate amount of body roll but dont't let that scare You. The car tracks and goes where u point it even when pushed to the limit as long as the tires handle it. Emergency handling is extremly precise and controlable without any suprises again as long as u have rubber that grips. The silence is the key word for this car. Weather cruising at 60mph or 100 mhp this car is extremly quite from engine to windnoise. excellent noise filtering over rough payvament. Great interior layout too. Love the gauges. great seats for long travel.
