I really have enjoyed the drivability of this car but the automobile has a great many flaws. I thought the transmission dying and shifting to neutral was just my imagination until I read these reviews today. Mine tends to act up more when it is windy and into a headwind. (The tranny shifted out of gear three times over two miles). I am also having squeaking and rattling problems with the dash and doors the tray above the radio is stuck. The perforated leather has "Hair" (leather backing) poking through the perforations. The cell phone interference with the radio is a hassle I just have to set the radio on the passenger seat.
