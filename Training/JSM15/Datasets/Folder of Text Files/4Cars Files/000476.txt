The BMW 528i is a good car but it has the potential to be the great car. It drives and rides very well but the quality of some components are not up to par for cars in the luxury division. And the annoying squeaks that alone is enough to bring this car to the level of an economy car. I can recommend the car for its performance but for us this may be our first and last BMW. If we want a quality car we will buy another Mercedes.
