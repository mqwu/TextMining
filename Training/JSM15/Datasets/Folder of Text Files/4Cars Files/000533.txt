A nice car for a young professional. Ride quality is excellent descent handling and acceleration. Luxury feel. Looks best in black on black with chrome wheels. Overall it beats M-B Audi A6 2.8 in terms of luxury. Stereo is nice ( but not awsome). Back seat legroom and headroom is inadequate for large adults. In my opinion it's the best choice in near luxury segment.
