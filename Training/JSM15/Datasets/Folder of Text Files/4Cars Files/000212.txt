This is a great vehicle. I will say that it is the best car I have ever owned. It has great fit and finish and the V8 has ample power whenever you need it. I was a bit miffed when the door handle broke but things happen. The handle was fixed under warranty and that is the only problem I have had. I would definitely opt for the sport package if I could do it over again because I would like a stiffer suspension and the non-sport wheels dont't look as good. Be prepared to upgrade the factory stereo if you are an audiophile.
