In a nutshell... this car has been a technilogical nightmare. The computer system that operates the airbag (SRS) system has failed twice where the entire system has to be replaced. Each time it's taken nearly 2 weeks. I was provided a replacement vehcile by the dealership however it was typically a C240... not quite the E500 I'm paying for. There had been one other time SRS light came on. This time with random other electric problems. It didnt't require computer replacemnt however I was once again without my car for nearly a week.    I asked the factory to buy the car back from me as I felt that three times having the SRS not working warrented a substantial safety issue and was told by the service manager at Fletcher Jones that MBUSA doesnt't think that the SRS failing doesnt't warrent a substantial failure in the safety functions of the car and that it wouldn't fall under the CA Lemon Law provision.    I wouldn't recommend this car. I wouldn't recommend this dealership. I dont't know what happened to quality with Mercedes-Benz but evidently it's been lost.
