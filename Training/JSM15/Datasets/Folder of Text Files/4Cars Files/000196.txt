The only thing I can say is that I have had this car for over a year now and the only significant amount of money that I have spent on the car was basically aftermarket products. In terms of repairs or replacement well only the battery!!! It's one of those cars that is excellent all around. Performance looks luxury and reliable!!!!! If you have any where between 8000 or 14000 bucks and you are looking for a superb sedan or coupe then a Legend is for you!!!!! For less money you can also purchase the ninety and earlier models which are just as beautiful!!
