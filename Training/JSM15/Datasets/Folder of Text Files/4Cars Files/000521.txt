After a year of researching cars I decided to purchase an CarZZ RL. I drive over 30k miles a year and I wanted a luxury vehicle which was reliable and asthetically handsome. I have only owned my Black on black RL for 1 week and so far I think I'm happy with my choice. The price was great ($16250 with 50k Miles) considering all the features especially compared to the Lexus 400 and the 5 series BMW.  The exterior in my opinion is much more refined and better looking than either of the fore-mentioned and the interior is just beautiful! I plan on owning this vehicle for many years to come and I'm hoping that it will be as reliable as a honda-made car should be. The car is wonderful to drive smooth and sharp. I test drove the Lexus GS300 and the Q45 - this was more comparable to the Q45 although the engine is smaller...who needs a V8 anyway?
