Yeah! I finally got my first car! Although I got this car for less than a month I'm very please with the performance. First of all the power of this car is amazing. I can't seem to obey the speed limit law the car just want to go. Nice exterior and interior design although the interior could use a bit of room. The audio is better than i expected. It produces good bass when you set the bass up but i only use on the 4th level. My favoraite features gotta be the pull out armrest. This is very cool considering you drive on your left and rest your right arm on it. And also the xenon headlights on this thing. Very bright and clear. The wheels are good although i prefer 6 spokes and 18"+ rims. The gas milage on this car is also great. I can go about 200 miles and the guage still 1/6 full. I didntt get the one with navi because it's two thousand dollars more plus tax. Why botherjust buy a $5 map and hit the road!    Before buying this my brother and I went to look at the infiniti G-35. Wow! this car is a great car with tremendous power(260 horses). The engine is a bit loud when accelerate but it's a powerful sport car. The interior is good but in the back is too cramped up even with the adujustable back seat.After we donte test driving it we went to the sales office and talk about the price. The one I want with the premium and winter package is $34000. I asked the salesguy if he can drop it a little. The guy said "no that's the final price!" He said Infiniti only want to sell it certain people who can afford it(i'm only 18 the guy prbably think i can't pay for it.) I was pissed off and left. A few weeks later after I bought my Tl-s the guy called and said He can sell the one in the showroom for $30000. I was like "helll no" I got my type s already and its great!
