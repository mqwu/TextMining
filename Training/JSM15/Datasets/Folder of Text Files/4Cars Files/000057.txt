The C280 is not a sports car but its 2.8 liter engine has no problem cruising at 80mph on safe highways.    The Flex Service System (FSS) does away with traditional 3000-mile oil changes. Flex Services on the C280 are every 10000-20000 (365-750 days).    A well engineered automobile ruled by extraordinary safety features. Add the moonroof CD/Bose audio system and obvious style and you have a winner.
