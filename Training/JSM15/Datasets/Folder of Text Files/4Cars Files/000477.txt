This is my first Mercedes and will probably be my last. While a fabulous car in many ways owning it has been a "high maintenance" experience from just about every standpoint. I was expecting a higher level of dealer service and thought an MB dealer would be better about just "taking care" of problems. Don't be blinded by the "image of a Mercedes" if you choose this car.
