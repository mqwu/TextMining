I drove nice Honda Accords for 4 years and I upgraded to the best honda sedan on the market. . .the 3.5RL and I must say I love every inch of it! I got a 97' with 31000 miles on it for $22500 about 4 or 5 thousand under blue book. Not only that but I got a 100000 mile bumper to bumper warrenty that covers everything even electronics because there are 8 onboard cpu's. This car has the best V6 I've ever driven(excluding the BMW M3) and it has all the luxeries ever needed however if you're like me then you need sportiness(I was about to buy an RX-7 but the insurance is out of this world when you're only 20 years old). . .so there is a place called Comptech Motorsports that upgrades the RL. It's basically the only place where you can purchase aftermarket parts for a 3.5RL. I've added a high-flow air filter cross-drilled rotors and competiton brake pads which has given my RL a performance boost. I still plan on getting a front strutbar brake lines 18inch rims and they even have lowering springs that lower it 1.5" in the front and 1.2" in the rear if you use the lowering springs make sure you buy the koni adjustable shocks and camber kit as well. After all those mods my RL will not only be very luxerious but will handle accelerate and brake as well as any other luxery sedan! Oh yeah and dont't forget this car is beautiful as well especially with all tinted windows and 18inch rims.
