The CarZZ overall is disappointing. I was expecting a sports sedan but instead the car has turned out to be neither a very good sports sedan nor a very good luxury car. The driver's seat comfort is the worst since a 1981 Chrysler rental I once drove. I didnt't pick up on it during the test drive but it sure bugs me now. The brakes and responsiveness of the suspension do not inspire confidence; they can't keep up with the speed the car is capable of. The headrests are unsafe (too far back in the front seats and too low in the rear seat). Perhaps CarZZ listened to focus groups rather than having donte the right thing and installing properly designed headrests. The design team that worked on the interior need further experience; they should check out other cars such as the Audi A6 and yes the CarZZ RL. The service at Oakland CarZZ is superb; they saved the day when the car had a difficult to diagnose electrical problem (fixed under warranty).
