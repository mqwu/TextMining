I am driving this car for more than 5 years I am not satisfied with its gear changing with jerk feature(gear changing is not smooth) dealer changed my bise stero system once. 4 window regulator gone bad dealer changed one under warrenty 3 others i changed for more than one grant definitely you can expect a break down in its automatic window regulators with in 3 years of use.I never heard in my life 3 automatic window regulators go bad with in 3 months for this kind of high costly car.Breaks are not poerful enogh to stop in emergency situations.CarZZ has to do more home work on this.Steering is heavy not smooth as a MB e320 or lexus ls400.Vehicle stability is another problem but better than any American cars.
