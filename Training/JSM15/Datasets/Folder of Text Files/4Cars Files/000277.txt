In 15 years and over 100K miles this car has never disappointed. I perform all routine service myself. Other than battery brake pads tires timing belt (at 85K miles) I haven't had to change much. (One bulb burnt out in all these years.) Still original struts and exhaust system. It is still as quiet and performs as well as when new. Passes California's tough smog inspection by a factor of 10. This is an amazing automobile.
