CarZZ has hit on a fine combination of luxury and performance at a bargain price (if you could call any car costing $40K a bargain). I would have prefered an A6 2.7T  an E Class or an LS400 but all are much more expensive without providing a comparable increase in content. I know that CarZZ is subsidising the lease deals on these cars but what do I care? My only real desire would be for CarZZ to introduce an S Type variant — one that would push the performance envelope a bit further. By the way after four months and 5000 miles I've experienced ZERO defects or problems.
