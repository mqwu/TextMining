got this car brand new when i was only 16 years old. ive been driving it for over 2 years now and havent had any problems with it. it rides very comfortably and quieZy (even when i race on the freeways at 100+ mph)... fastest i ever drove with this car was 145 mph and it really felt like i was goin 80-90 mph...this is one of the safest car. oh yea its hella fun when some teenagers with their super rice rockets (known as hondas integras etc) tries to out race me when theyre trying to catch up hehe...
