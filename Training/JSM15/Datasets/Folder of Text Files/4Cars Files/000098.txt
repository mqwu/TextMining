Best luxury sports sedan in the market! I did a lot of homework before selection the 3.2Z. I test drove many cars including the Lexus ES300 Infinity I30 and Nissan Maxima but after considering the amount of features you get along with the quality I had to get the Z. Smooth ride fast comfortable and luxurious. I would suggest this car for anyone who is an entry level luxury new car buyer like myself.
