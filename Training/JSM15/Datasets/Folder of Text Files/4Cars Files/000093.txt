Very smooth ultra fast and responsive acceleration. Top handling and monster growl in 4.4 V-8 motor. I find that once i'm on the road all the pikers driving hondas mustangs etc come out of the woodwork trying to race me. This is how it usually ends up I give them a slight handicap since i'm a nice fellow and then i spare them no mercy i gas on the accelerator and i'm warp speeding ahead of them like they were driving a tricycle. I've gone as fast as 130MPH and almost to the 140-150 mark.. Last night some clown in a Mustang thought he could race me i just blew past him at 120 and then 130 and he was history. He wouldn't stay down and tried to make a come back..so i let him have it and the motor revved to 145 and he was dust..he had to pitifully bail out by going towards the nearest exit to save face. I think the only cars that can contend with 540i 4.4 V-8 is either 911 porsche ferrari corvette M5 and 850i. All others are in the rearview mirror..
