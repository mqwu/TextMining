I have owned a Lexus ES300 for more than 8 years now. I am still amazed at times as to how well the vehicles still rides how it still handles and how much value that I've gotten out of it. Approaching almost 170000 miles nothing but normal maintenance has been involved and it is still sweet. Now I've seen a picture of the 2002 Lexus and I must say except for the rear end it is going to be "cookin' with gas" as my mother would say. However it will have to be sizzling before I'd be willing to take a very good paid off '92 ES300 and trade it in for this hot new model.
