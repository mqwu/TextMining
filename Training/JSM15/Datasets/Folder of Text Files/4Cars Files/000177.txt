I fell in love with the type-S the moment I revved the motor to red-line. I've taken this car to 64 mph in SECOND GEAR!! This engine roars when you floor the acceleration and will beat almost anything with four doors from 0 to 60mph. I love all the little extras that come standard on this relatively in-expensive package like the passenger side wing mirror that automatically tilts down while reversing; or the heated front seats; or the 6-disc in dash CD player. BMW and Mercedes absolutely ROB you if you ask for things such as these. It's hard to believe this is a front wheel drive car as the handling is better than a lot of BMWs I've driven. The VSA (Vehicle Stability Assit) is nice and non-intrusive providing help only there is absolutely no chance I can recover the road myself. I also like that the sportshift doesnt't upshift by itself(aside from going from 1st to 2nd). I've had a nasty experience with a Lexus that decided to shift from 3rd to 4th gear during a rather perilous turn which caused it to almost spin off the road. One interesting observation is that although the Z offers limited head room (I'm 6'3 and have about two inches of room above my head) it is the ONLY car in my recent recollection that offers enough leg room so that I'm not driving with the steering wheel between my knees. The steering wheel placement is very nice and the seat position offers GREAT visibility. I dislike the cheap fake wood that comes standard with a black interior on the Type-S and have had that replaced. I would recommend this car to almost anyone. If you are in the market for a car that doesnt't break the bank drives like a dream and still offers enough creature comforts to make those long drives enjoyable PLEASE do yourself a favor and test-drive the Z Type-S it won't disappoint.
