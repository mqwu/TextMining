1993 and later E class cars are a pleasure to drive and scary to maintain. The 24v engine is flawless and fast with good gas milage and sreams when you want it to but the car is more complex than a nuclear sub which is a shame because MB never needed to try to keep up the Japs and offer a bunch of crap that's just going to break after a while and cost the owner a pretty penny. If you want a quality station wagon (or sedan) though there's nothing that compares to it. It's a car that will reward you with it's seamless dynamics and one you can drive all day long without any problem and you can drive the car for the rest of your life if you maintain it well. If you want to go really fast haul the kids and look good doing it this car is perfect. (as long as you can afford the entry fee!)
