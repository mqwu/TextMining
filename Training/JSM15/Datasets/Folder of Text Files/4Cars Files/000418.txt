Bought the car in 2002 with 60k miles on it. Looks and runs like new. It now has 84k miles on it had to replace an oxygen sensor check engine light came on to tell me this. Had to have the front rotors resurfaced I warped them some how. Probably breaking hard at 80 mph which in my opinion shouldn't hurt a car that costs over 40k new. Other than that I have changed the oil and put gas in it. People get in it and think it is a new car I laugh and tell them it has 84k miles on it. They look at me kindof funny.
