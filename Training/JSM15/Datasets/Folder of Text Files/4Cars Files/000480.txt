This car is really beautiful inside and out (except for kinda dull wheels). Unfortunately the mechanicals do not seem to be what I expect in a Lexus! I also have the same transmission problems as others reviewed on this website along with some additional problems.    Quite often when trying to take off slowly with the car; it pauses as if it isn't quite in gear. Then all at once the car will lock in and surge forward!    This behavior not only jerks around myself and passengers but also makes moving into traffic a bit interesting.    The car will also develop a significant shutter when traveling a steady speed of 50MPH of so. This is also pretty jerky but much harder to recreate.    My ES300 currently has about 22000 miles on it and drives like a car with about 100000 on it. The tires are making significant noise on the highway and passing from 40MPH or so is a real joke.    Like others on this site I am very dissatisfied with the car and will also be pursuing the Lemon Law.    I've been trying to get this problem fixed from the time I purchased it in October 2001.
