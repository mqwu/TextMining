The car is great. Built solid single owner before me i bought it at 90k miles for about $12K and have already put 16k miles on it. It is fun to drive (i actually look forward to driving it everyday). It is a lot more fun to drive than any other car (like a civic or an accord) and is also built very solidly. THe computer on board is great (even for a 2001 car and this is a 1992 car!) I beleive BMW has become a bit more commercial now... but iin 1992 i believe they were not skimping on the material in theoir cars... the engine in this car will probaly work on a battleship..... I aim to own this car for at least another 7-8 years more if not longer (unless osmething happens). My plan is to keep putting 1500 or so a year on average into it and this will keep it running like a top and ultimately make it a classic. There is something about powning a well kept Bimmer that is ....hhh..well it;s the same feeling as owning an automatic Swiss watch i guess...or wearing handstitched English shoes.....it's juts a feeling of quality and well being.... if you are the kind of person who'd buy ONE quality thing and care for it rather than buy a new piece of trash every 5 years then buy a used Bimmer save some money and have fun!
