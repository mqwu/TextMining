I am trying to trade this car for an AUDI S4  I test drove one and it drives alot better . What lexus doesntt tell you is that the car loses about 10 to 15% of its value the moment you drive it off the lot. I reccomend this car for anyone who likes to go crusing. You can put twin turbos on a GS300  its has a I6 supra motor.
