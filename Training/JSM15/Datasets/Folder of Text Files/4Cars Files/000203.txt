This is a great car if you value performance first and luxury second. If your priorites are different the Audi or MB is a better choice. Yes other cars may accelerate as fast or faster but only on a boring straight line. They dont't stop as fast either. Get the manual transmission and sport suspension. This is just another German luxury car without it. The ride is not too harsh. Flimsy cup holders are placed there by German Engineers to remind us sloppy Americans not to eat or drink in thier cars. One really can't eat or drink in this car and drive it the way it should be driven. So far dealer experience has been excellent in all aspects. (Herb Chambers)
