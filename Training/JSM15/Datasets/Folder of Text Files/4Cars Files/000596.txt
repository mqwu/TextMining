WOW what a ride!!! I have ridden in European cars before but BMW does have the ultimate driving machine. It runs like a dream. I only wish they a 540 wagon ready I would have taken it in a heartbeat. We drive the car for 400 miles get out and feel as though we have not gone anywhere it is very confortable. Worth the money. We got in Alpine white it definitely has eyes.
