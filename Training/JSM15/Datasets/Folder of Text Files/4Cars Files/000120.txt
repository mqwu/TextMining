The car is a must have. It’s the prime example of high performance in a luxury car. I've tested the BMW's and other cars that for some reason was considered to be in the class of the CLK and found them to be a total disappointment. We also have a 1989 420sel which spoiled our taste in well-built cars which now can only be satisfied by Mercedes.
