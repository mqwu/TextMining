I checked for hours evey option and rating of BMW and Mercedes. If you want the best for your money and reliability NOTHING beats the Lexus. Please check for yourself I have. You may not beat the BMW racing around the corners of Monoco but you will pass it as it breaks down. The Mercedes is about 10G more for each of its Lexus conterparts. Why spend more for a name when you can get the Lexus and the leather is softer and the ride is quieter and you will never see any repair costs.
