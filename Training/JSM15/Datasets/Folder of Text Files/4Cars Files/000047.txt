My 9 month old '02 3.2Z's transmission needed TOTAL replacement at 20000 miles. Brake pads and Rotors were also found to be faulty at time of repair (Cerritos CarZZ would only "re-grind" rotors vs. replacing them with new ones). Transmission failed on me and caused me to crash vehicle. I immediately delivered vehicle to Cerritos CarZZ. While en-route via freeway to Cerritos CarZZ for repairs the transmission would slip out of gear and redline. Worse yet it also dropped into "park" several times while doing 55mph. This was without a doubt my most terrifying experience in a vehicle...was nearly rear-ended twice on freeway while trying to get to Cerritos CarZZ for repairs.    Reported incident to NHTSA and hope other owners follow suit. Many similar experiences painted all over internet including NHTSA's website.
