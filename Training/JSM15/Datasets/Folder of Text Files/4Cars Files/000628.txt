$32500 with Premium package and only 16000 miles on it. In Southern California it's a great price. It is a '97 though so it's pricey. CAme with premium package sunroof etc. I had a 2000 528 on loan from the dealer it was a noticibly better car and slighly faster with 5 speed auto instead of four speed. I would recommend this car only to those with extra money available to enjoy this toy. Why shouldn't this be a great car when it lists for over $40000 when new?
