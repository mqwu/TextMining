Purchased the car in April of 2003.This car is simply the best value for your money. Search the web and you will agree. Buy this car only if you want the absolute bang for the buck. Otherwise if you can afford another 10 to 13 grand opt for the BMW 330. This car is a jack of all trades but a master of none. Performance is excellent in straight acceleration only(freeway on ramp and etc). The car struggles heavily to balance itself during hard cornering. Front wheel drive and skinny tires make it worse. German build quality and handling is by far milestones ahead of Japanese handling. Turning radius is horrible. All CarZZs except the RL is made in Ohio and that has compromised the once renowned build quality of Honda/CarZZ vehicles. My Interior center console simulated wood trim fell out because the adhesive and the metal clips were defective. Rear passenger interior door panel came loose due to missing clips. Moon roof has rattling noise.The RL is made 100% in Japan. Go to any CarZZ showroom and look at the fit and finish of the RL compared to TL and all other CarZZ cars and you will discover that the RL is far ahead in quality and craftsmanship. Even Honda knows and will not take any chances when it comes to building their flagship RL sedan and prefers to build it in Japan. The car is great as a daily driver and is marketed toward past and present accord owners. If you are a buyer considering the present S-Type or the Accord V-6 and looking for performance then go with the S-Type. Those of you considering the standard TL or the TL S-Type get the S-Type. Do not even consider the standard TL(a good car still no doubt). If you absolute must have superb fit and finish quality and performance look to BMW(Be willing to pay for it though). After its all said and donte the TL S-Type is a great buy fun to drive and pound for dollar and dollar for pound.
