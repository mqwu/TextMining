I am really enjoying my GS300 experience and feeling absolutely no buyers remorse after buying the car. The word that frequenZy comes to mind as I drive it is "refinement". The overall engineering is superb to anything I have owned or driven in recent memory. The big gripe about this car (1993-1997 GS's) is that it's sluggish nature off the line and that is 100% accurate. Therefore if you are considering this car and 0-60 is important to you go find different car. If however you want to enjoy nearly everything else about owning the finest line of automobiles on the road then this is your car.
