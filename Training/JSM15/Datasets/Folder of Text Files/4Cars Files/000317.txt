I paid $28100 w/o tax. I actually recommend going through the internet. It can save you $500-1000 of MSRP (I used Autoweb.com). To date I have no regrets about the acquisition of my 2000Z. I would definitely recommend this automobile. For the money you pay you are getting substantially more automobile & features than a ES300 IS LS & I30** **(Based on personal research I conducted prior to purchase).
