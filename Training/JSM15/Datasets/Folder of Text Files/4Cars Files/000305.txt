My 2 year old CarZZ CL recenZy had the transmiaaion experience a total meltdown..with no warning. The TCS light suddenly came on along with the check engine light. Within 5 miles the tranny would not stay in any gear and the car was incapacitated on a busy stretch of highway out of cell phone range and with no pull outs.
