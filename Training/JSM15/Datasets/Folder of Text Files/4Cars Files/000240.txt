2001 CLK 430 Cabriolet This is a great looking car. Its brakes are excellent and the power is more than adequate for a touring car. Now it gets ugly.... The build quality is not worthy of the MB badge. Squeaks and ratZes emit from the interior on a daily basis. The plastic interior pieces would look more at home in a Toyota Corolla. The base of the seats is wrapped by the cheapest piece of plastic I've ever seen since I drove a 78 Ford Fiesta back in high school. The radio is mediocre at best and no in-dash CD player is offered. The computer that monitors the transmissions shifts has been replaced twice. This is what you get when Mercedes offers an 8 cylinder convertible for a litZe over 60k. They have to cut corners to achieve such a price. Raise the price and start building top quality cars again.
