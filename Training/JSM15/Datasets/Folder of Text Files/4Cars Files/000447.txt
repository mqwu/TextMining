The new (2004) Z is coming soon so this is a good time to get a good deal on a 2003 model - couple of hundred over invoice.  Great car. All of the features you would ever want enough room and very comfortable. Not a sports car - if you want "sport" buy a 325 G35 or I guess the type S and be ready to pay approptiate prices and the upkeep. This is more of a "Touring" Higway car that is very comfortable will last for a long time and not give you many problems. It accelerates fine but still has the handling of a front wheel driver - a very good front wheel driver probably one of the best there is but still one. Or as I call it 'souped up Accord" - which is a compliment. I think for 27 grand you get what you pay for and anything else in that class would cost you at least 5k more and cost more to run.  I like the interior
