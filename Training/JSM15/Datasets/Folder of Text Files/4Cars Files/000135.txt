Just love the power and looks of this car. Have only had the car for four days now and couldn't believe the 03's were out already. Comes with many features that are all standard. I'm glad I opted for the Nav system and am still learing how to use it.. Was going to go with the Type S but my wife complained   too much about the seat belt digging into her hip. I do wish it had a little more head room for my 6-4 size. I can adjust the seat to accomodate me but anyone seating behind me will suffer.
