This is my first car. I purchased it with over 250000 miles eight months ago. It has 16" Borbet Type H alloy wheels with 225/50R16 tires (standard wheels are 14"). Dry-weather handling is superb. The car is equipped with ABS as a standard feature and braking is also very good. However under light braking from 40-60 mph the steering wheel will often shake rather violently. This is apparently a somewhat common problem on older 3- and 5-Series. The car is equipped with automatic transmission and is not exceptionally quick (121 hp out of the 2.7L inline-6). Shifts are usually quite smooth. I am considering a performance chip from either Dinan or AutoThority. Highway cruising on the other hand is no problem. Except for noise from the low-profile tires the car is comfortable at any speed. Cruising at 80+ mph is effortless. The seats are very comfortable and the interior has many thoughtful features from an illuminated glovebox to an onboard computer to power headrests. Cupholders are sorely lacking. The glovebox and trunk are both large. A 6-disc CD changer in the trunk augments a passable 4-speaker audio system. 91-octane fuel is recommended. In the eight months I've owned it the car as had few problems none of them major. Some parts are very expensive (one taillight assembly is $225) but as far as BMW parts go prices aren't that high. Although I would have much preferred an E34 (89-95) 5-Series like a 525i I have found this two-generation old 5 wonderfully satisfying. I would highly recommend it to someone with limited financial resources who still would like the superior design and character of a BMW. If you want a blisteringly quick car avoid the 528e. However for solid feel and overall driving enjoyment this car is hard to beat.
