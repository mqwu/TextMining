Normally I would not provide a review. But this car has been so unbelievably reliable that I thought it might benefit those who are looking at buying a quality used car. For $15-$20K this used car is an absolute steal compared to others that can be purchased for the same price. The under-powered issue is a benefit to those who dont't care much about performance because it keeps the price down. I hear so many horror stories about breakdowns impossible to diagnose problems etc. from friends and acquaintances. I feel like I am living in a vacuum in that this car was so well put together. I know some day it will fall apart - it is just a machine. But until then I can drive stress free and in absolute comfort. As a side benefit I am treated differently for driving this car. Business associates friends valets all appreciate the quality of the car when they ride in it. They cannot believe it is eight years old. As well the dealer treats me (and particularly my wife) like royalty. We have been in for service only (no repairs) but we still get brand new courtesy cars and Godiva chocolates. You could eat off of the service bay floor.
