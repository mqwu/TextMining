The Car is veryyy goood. I liked the day I drove this car.. I planned to but an Infiniti I-30. The ride was quite stiff and so were the seats. The Navi on the I30 sucks. By the time it tells you how to go. you would have gone by then. We bought two cars from the same dealer with the same config. was at the end of the month and the July 4th week. so got a pretty good deal from the dealer.
