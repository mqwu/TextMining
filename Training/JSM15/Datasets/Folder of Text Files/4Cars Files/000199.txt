The first time I saw it was nice. It was a huge value even though it had over 110000 miles on it. Hey it's a diesel it'll last forever!!! Now it has nearly 190000 miles on it and we've only had to fix some things. 1) rebuilt Transmition at 130000 2) Alternator at 150000 3) Alternator again due to glow plugs (free) at 160000 4) Glow Plug related thing at 180000 5) Driver's window motor at 180000 Lives up to the name MERCEDES-BENZ
