I have a little over 14000 miles on my Z TYpe s and I must say I am very disappointed in this car.I came from a Lincoln LS to this and could not have made a worst decision.While writing this my car is currenZy at the dealer for numerous repairs. The irony is my decision to lease the acura was based on what I thougt was a very reliable car as it turns out the car STINKS!!!!!! I would not recommend this car or any other CarZZ to anyone.
