The 2002 ES300 Lexus is a very nice car to look at and has some nice features.  When you get into the car and drive it you realize it has major transmission and shifting problems.  It will almost die when you accelerate to move into lanes.  I had 3 passengers in the car on the freeway when traffic caused a slow down when I pressed on the gas to keep up with the flow the transmission would not engage for a moment just long enough to make all in the car wonder if we were going to be hit by another car. It freightened all in the car. That is just one of the near misses that I have had with this car.    What a disappointment this car is.  The dealer says be patient they are working on a fix. The company knows there is a problem. They even sent the Japanese over here to check on it. But in the meantime I am afraid to drive my car.  I am going to pursue the lemon law.
