 As a sports sedan the ES 300 does not quite cut it when you consider it has the A4 and 330i for competition. The engine is woefully underpowered and the transmission seems to have a mind of its own. It takes a second or two before the wheels start responding to increased throttle. The suspension does not have that solid-glued-to-the-ground feel and the car often nose-dives when you corner sharply. The redeeeming factor is its interior which is gorgeous. The front dashboard is thoughtfully laid out and Lexus's stereo is tyhe best that I have heard in a car yet. I hear the 02 ES 300 gets the Mark Levinson which should be a substantial improvement. On smooth roads the ride is eirely quiet but take this car over a bumpy road and the tire noise is very audible. If you're looking for a sports sedan the IS 300 is a better bet. However if you're looking for a family sedan that will probably last for a decade then the ES 300 may be the car for you.
