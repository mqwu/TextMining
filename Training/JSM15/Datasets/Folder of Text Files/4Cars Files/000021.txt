I had my front left window broken(Regulator) just after the 50000 warrenty expires i payed 450 dollar for that an CarZZ dealer to fix it just after two months my back two window regulators are broken i felt very bad on this with the CarZZ they had covered my parts at this time not the labour another couple of hundred dollars i had to spent on this.. When i told the sad story to CarZZ client service manager Allen he refused to give me the labour to cover... BAD CAR ... and a BAD experiance ..
