This car is a complete dissapointment. It's been in the shop so many times that it's ridiculous. Other than the convertible hardtop nothing else on the car works reliably. Even the trunk gets stuck closed. The interior is rather cheap for a mercedes and creaks atrociously. The car is rather obnoxiously creaky and rattly on the highways. Definitely a waste of money and time.
