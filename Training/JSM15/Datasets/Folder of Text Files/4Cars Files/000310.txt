I always wanted a Mercedes SL but never had deep enough pockets to afford one. I thought that the SLK was the answer. The styling is a little quirky but that didnttttt't bother me. This was afterall a Mercedes convertible. When driving around town at low speeds the SLK is fine and handles well. When driving at highway speeds the car is loud. Now sometimes a loud car is a good thing but the SLK sounds like it's sick. The noise becomes quite obnoxious after a half hour of driving. The top has been stuck in the up position a few times. I'm told by the dealer that this was due to extreme heat. The shifter is still very stiff and not very sporting. The quality of the materials used in this vehicle is questionable for a Mercedes. I've never seen such cheap plastic in an MB not even in a friend's old 190e. I do find the seats very comfortable. Bottom Line: I should have waited until I can afford MB's real convertible.
