Bought a 320 coupe 2 years ago and loved it ever since. Though the CL500 looks a lot better the CLK performs just as well. Except the handling was a little weak during turns and manuvers. SO I got my self some 19" Brabus Monoblock V 2piece and the car is perfect. If you dont't want ratZes or squeak then dont't get a cabrio.
