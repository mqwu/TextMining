QUIETEST ENGINE EITHER FLOORING THE GAS PEDAL OR STANDING STILL WAITING FOR THE COP CAR WITH SIREN ON TO GO BY. LOVE THE POWER & ADJUSTABLE STEERING WHEEL COLUMM. THIS IS MY FIRST LEXUS AND WILL NOT BE MY LAST EITHER . I DEFINITELY AND STRONGLY RECOMENDEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS CAR OVER THE OTHER CARS IN ITS CLASS...I RECENTLY TEST DROVE THE NEWLY RE-DESIGN 2001 M.BENZ C320 (STICKER AT $42000)AND HOPING THAT M.B WILL CHANGE MY MIND AND GET ME IN ONE OF THEIR COST MORE PRODUCTS. NOT A CHANCE LET'S JUST SAY I WILL KEEP MY GS 300.
