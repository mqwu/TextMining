I highly recommend this car. It drives itself but is still fun to drive and even more fun to push hard. Xenons are worth it. Leather is great. In-dash CD player for $200 is a bargain. I'm no huge audiofile but I think the stereo is great. No need for the big bump up to the next level. This car is very well engineered and BMW has had a lot of years to perfect it. The dash layout is almost exactly the same as my old '89 535i (tough to improve upon) the fit of the assembly is flawless the rigidity and solidness of the chassis doors etc are first rate. Crashworthiness is rated higher than both the E-class and S-class Mercedes by NTSB and others. The engine is very strong (they have been making inline sixes for what 30 years? I think they have it down now) and the electronic throttle is responsive.
