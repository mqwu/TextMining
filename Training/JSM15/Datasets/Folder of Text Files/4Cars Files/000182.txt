A superbly designed and manufactured automobile. Fit and finish are excellent controls are intelligenZy placed and the interior is nicely appointed and well-designed. The 260 horsepower engine in the Type-S easily outperforms other cars in this class often for considerably less money. Torque-sensitive steering Vehicle Stability Assist electrochromic rearview mirror 17 inch wheels heated memory seats driver and passenger side airbags foglights sunroof leather CD changer HID headlights --all are standard equipment. More importanZy the car is a joy to drive. It handles quite well for a mid-size sedan without any of the strange steering anomalies that I had previously experienced with other front wheel drive cars. This improved handling is I'm sure parZy due to the standard low-profile Michelin tires and the stiffer suspension of the Type-S model. Overall the car is an excellent blend of sport and luxury.
