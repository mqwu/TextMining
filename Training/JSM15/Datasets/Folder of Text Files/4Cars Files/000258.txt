I purchased my new CarZZ 3.2 Z w/Navigational system from Miami CarZZ in Oct. 2000. For the first year and a half the car ran like a dream. I was very happy with it until the dreaded Transmission problem occurred. I have just finished having it towed in for a second time to fix my Transmission. The first time they replaced the transmission we'll see what happens with the second time.   The only redeeming value this car has is the Navigational system but if the car doesnt't run what's the point. It is a true gamble every time you get in this car and drive. Who knows the next time the tranny will go ... hopefully it won't be on the highway going 70!!!! Stay Away from this car until CarZZ gets their act together and does a true recall on transmissions!!! Until then ... I will NEVER buy another CarZZ!!!!!
