Very nice car with lots of toys. Gives a very smooth ride and has lots of power! interior is nice but could use a update with rounder vents and gadgets. the exterior styling needs a rounder roof with higher lines to bring this car into the future and break it away from a side profile that looks similar to a 1992 thunderbird. Oh yea get rid of the chrome door handles
