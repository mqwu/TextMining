This is the first Lexus I have owned and I can definitely say that it will NOT be the last. This car is great! I was blown away by how much better it is than other cars I've driven in the past. I always thought BMW and Mercedes were the best luxury cars out there but now that I've switched over to Lexus I am very happy with my choice. As an added bonus Lexus dealers actually treat you like a human being which is nice compared to the horrible treatment I've received from BMW and Mercedes dealers in the past. They act like they're actually doing you a favor by showing you their cars. Give me a break! When you go to a Lexus dealership they're happy to see you and they will treat you better than you've ever been treated at a car dealership. Go to your nearest Lexus dealer and see what I mean......I didnt't believe it either until I actually went to one and found out for myself. As for the car it is nothing short of spectacular. The fit and finish are superb(Lexus is better in this department than any other car on the market IMHO) the exterior design turns heads everywhere I take it the interior surrounds you in comfort and elegance and while it's not as fast as a Ferrari it is plenty powerful for a luxury sedan and very smooth in the process. The car drives effortlessly and is so quiet that you can't even tell if the engine is running most of the time. It goes over bumps and imperfections in the road like you're driving on glass and it has every option imaginable. Well I thought it had everything until I checked out the specs on the LS430.......wow that car is loaded with things that shouldn't even be available in an automobile. It costs nearly $30000 more than my GS however so I'll sacrifice a few options and keep the extra cash right now. In closing I can definitely recommend this car to prospective buyers and I think they will be 100% satisfied with their purchase. I know that I am thrilled with my new GS 300 and I'll be enjoying it for several years.
