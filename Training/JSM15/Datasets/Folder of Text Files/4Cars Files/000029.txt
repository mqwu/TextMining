I purchased my 2003 Z in Nov. 2002 and have about 8000 miles on it. I purchased it mainly because of its reliability records good ride and resale value . I am somewhat disappointed with this car. It just isn't very exciting and has little or no "pazazz". This car is an adequate Sport Sedan  but should not be referred to as a LUXURY Sport Sedan. I just cant seem to get confortable in this car. I always feel as though I am "reaching" for the steering wheel ( it needs a telescoping steering wheel) and my knees feel to close to the dash. the center arm rest should be higher. The Z is a safe chioce but not very fun. I wish I would have went with the 325i or G35.
