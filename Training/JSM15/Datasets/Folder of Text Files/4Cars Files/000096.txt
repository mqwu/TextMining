I purchased my CarZZ after doing a ton of research. I loved the suspension because it wasn't very loose and I like the idea of feeling like I am in control. I come from a family of Honda Accord and Civic owners who have been very happy so I thought I would be happy in the CarZZ. Well I've come to the conclusion that these car magazines and websited must be on Hondas payroll.
