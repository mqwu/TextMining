The GS300 is a great car but it lacks the handling/prowess of its German competitors. For a sports-sedan it could have more power but I guess thats where the GS4 and after market upgrades come in handy. I'm only a high school student and the girls love it. Minor modifications (rims) really make this car stand out. It's not like all the other cars in the parking lot that everyone else has (Mustangs Camaros). Overall this is a great car but if I could go back I would have put more thought into it's German competitors. Those desiring the GS series should consider the 400/430 for more power. What I love about the GS is the interior has a great style compared to BMW. When you check out the interiors of the Beamers note there's not a sleek smooth design like the Lex. BMW interiors kind of basic.
