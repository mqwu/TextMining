Absolute Best Value in class after serious research. Navi as good as everyone says. Great acceleration throughout rpm range. Complaints about cheap interior are warranted. But superb engine handling and electronics trump all. I drove everything else. Infiniti came close but this car offered best balance of performance & comfort. Zero remorse after 6 months.
