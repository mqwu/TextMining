The five series BMWs have been great cars all along and are just now being rediscovered by America. I owned my first 5 for many years. I put over 200k on it and when I finally sold it the car still looked new! Perfect black leather interior and beautyful paint. The thing was fast as ever. I did want to move to something with the current safety standard though and I've been equally pleased with my 528.
