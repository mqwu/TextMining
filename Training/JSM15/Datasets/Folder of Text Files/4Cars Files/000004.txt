I can't even imagine buying any other car in the $25-35K price range. This car has the best of all worlds wrap into a beautiful driving experience. The car comes fully loaded the only accessories I added was a spoiler and Chrome Wheels. Wow! What a difference the $1300 ($700 for the spoiler $600 for stock rims chromed) in accessories added to the car. It was well worth the money. The dealership in Los Gatos was a pleasure to deal with and they gave me a screaming deal. $33000 including Nav and accessories.
