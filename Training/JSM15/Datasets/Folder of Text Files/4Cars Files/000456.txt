WOW what a deal. The dealer picked it up at an auction and sold it to me immediaZey once it passed inspection. I test drove it and knew immediaZey the engine was not 17 years old and i was impressed at the incredible power (far more than a 2001 Mustang GT). Once i bought it i looked up the part numbers and sure enough i discovered the previous owner had installed a 1988 E28 M5 engine (256hp)!!! I took it to my mechanic to confirm it. He told me it had new performance brakes and suspension as well as custom rims and CD player and that the engine has no more than 20000 miles on it!!! This car is by far the luckiest gamble i've ever taken. Everything is in almost perfect condition and it will be a classic in 2004!!!
