This SLK has only been in the shop for reqular maintenance twice in 20K miles. There was a door ratZe but the top has been through 288 cycles without a problem. I understand there is a major redesign for 2004. I would purchase another one. The 500 SL has a new feature. The top in the retracted state will pivot up and you can access the bottom of the trunk. Will this be a feature on the SLK?
