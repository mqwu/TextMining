I paid 34500 for the 3.2 Z in Canada (where the MSRP is 36000). I also got the rear mud guards wheel locks and the nose mask included in that price. Normally CarZZ dealers will not go down in price too much but I am sure that I got the price break because dealers are trying to clear their 2000 stock. Do I recommend this car? If you want a litZe luxury a quiet firm ride and enough power to kick some butt all at a reasonable price this may be the car for you. The 3.2Z is a good combination of quality luxury power and handling for its class. It does not excell in any single area (except maybe for the smooth automatic drive and the powerful engine) but it offers a solid product for the price.
