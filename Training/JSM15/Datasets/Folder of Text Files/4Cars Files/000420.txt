The drivetrain is all Mercedes. I love it. The styling is also perfect. After that things get ugly... The suspension needs some firming up it's just too darn soft. Mercedes how about dropping an extra grand on the interior? How long did it take you to find seats that squeak? This is a car that's an engineering compromise. MB cut many corners to make it affordable and it shows. However we leased the car for our law firm and in 39 months it'll be gone and we'll take a look and see what's out there once more. Maybe BMW will revive the 6 series in some incarnation.
