I got a deal through carsdirect.com when they first started so I got $3000 off sticker (when no one was dealing). I LOVE this car. This is basically my first/second car and I plan on keeping it until it dies which seems like it will be a LONG time. If you get a year model 2000 or later GET the DVD navigation it's amazing. The 1999 model had a hard drive which I didnt't want. The gas mileage is about normal although I usually get between 20-22 mpg in CITY and anywhere from 26-29 HWY. Highly recommended if you want a quality car LOTS of features and for it to last WAY into the future. I have about 46000 miles in 2 years and it runs like the day I got it! p.s. Love the Xenon headlights radio controls on steering wheel (a must) and everything about the engine & transmission (both are gorgeous).
