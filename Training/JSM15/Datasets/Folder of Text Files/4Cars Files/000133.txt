Wow. You get the most bang for the buck with the CarZZ. The new Type S with the 260 hp engine is fun to drive. For just under $32K you get just about everything...leather moonroof memory seats wood trim manumatic shifting 6CD changer ABS VSA(traction control) and the list goes on... Test drove the BMW AUDI and Maxima (and others) and the CarZZ was the best buy. Comparably equipped the others were $3-10K more expensive and there was less horsepower. I did like the Audi's Quattro and its torque but it came in about $10K over the CarZZ. Plus it was smaller(listed as a compact) so I couldn't justify the $40K + they were asking. BMW felt wimpy but it was a very nice car. Lexus Nissan and Infiniti weren't even in the running after all the test drives. If you get a chance(they are pretty scarce for now) drive it. You'll be happily surprised for what you get. Performance + Luxury for less than $32K. CarZZ needs to ramp up the RL's performance to keep up with its little siblings.
