I've had the car for a year now. Still fun to drive still fast no serious problem. Besides windshield rubber seal getting unglued on a few small spot the only gripe I have is about the winter tires. They just dont't exist in that size and I had to get smaller narrower ones which of course did not fit on the mags. No big deal (for someone who use to drive a Volvo!) I still really like the car.
