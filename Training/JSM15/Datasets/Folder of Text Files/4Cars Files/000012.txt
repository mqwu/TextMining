If this type of car appeals to you give the "E" class a try I do not think you will regret it. It says style breeding and class over and above the BMW Jag Lexus Etc. The interior has lots of room is comfortable and has the all-important three 3 point seatbelts in the rear (for anyone with three children). I think that the one thing that lets the interior down is the lack of suitably placed cup holders. The rear ones are in the centre arm rest and can't be used when three are in the back. The front ones are in the glove box which is a bit of a stretch if you're under six foot. The boot is a little on the small size when you're en route to an airport but is otherwise adequate. It is effortless to drive both in town and at speed. The car accelerates well after an initial flat spot. Driving or being driven in this car gives a feeling of well being. This is a car for drivers who want the best of all worlds; prestige performance and safety. I bought this car for my wife and family to use and I made the right decision.
