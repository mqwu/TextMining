The C230 Coupe is not the product that I expected from Mercedes Benz - for both better and worse. The Better-  The car is sporty and fun to drive. The handling is crisp. The 6 speed manual shifts very well although the clutch take 1-2 weeks to get used to. The car is very affordable - about the same as a high end Accord or GTI/Jetta or CarZZ Integra and Cheaper than the new Camry The Worse-  I had the Check Engine Light turn on within the first week of ownership. A part that measures the air-fuel ratio needed to be replaced. The dealer was very responsive and helpful. Mercedes Benz of Pleasanton sounds much better than some of these other dealers. But still I had paid $27400 in cash for the car just a few days earlier so this was a let down to have a maintenance problem.  Price above includes Californix Tax and License.
