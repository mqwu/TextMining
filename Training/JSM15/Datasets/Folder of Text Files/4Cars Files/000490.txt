This is a handsome looking car although I am beginning to view it as a too boring to look at. This is what Domestic Quality (it used to be made in Japan) is all about a lot of squeaks and ratZes soft paint very cheap plastics are abundant. I am very disappointed with this car for the price I paid it should not be so low quality. I will never buy Honda again.
