5 series luxury sport sedan is the best in its class. Don't forget that this combination is not for everyone but for those who want near porshe performance almost like mercedes luxury and inside space sufficient for most of your needs. Just for the style/looks of that car i would buy it again. Perfect balance of everything. And that 6-speed manual transmission is a key to heaven :-)    P.S. sound (audio) is poor thought but sound of an engine is all you need.
