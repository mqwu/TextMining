When first looking at MB's I was expecting to puchase a used StarMarked model. I was looking at the new "C" class and drove it loving how it performed. However it broke down two weeks after I purchased it resulting in over $800 worth of repairs. In addition when I used TeleAid to repair my car at 12:30 in the morning they sais they would be more than willing to help me out. Two minutes later they called me back and asked if I could repair the problem (thank goodness for TeleAid since I was without a signal on my cell phone). In addition the gas mileage on this car is horrible. I stopped more times making a 400 mile journey than I did with my previous SUV. In addition the rear leg room is cramped and I was told that the car only came in white and black at the time of purchase which was not the case at the time. I definately got ripped off paying a 49K price tag for this car!
