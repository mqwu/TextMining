An excellent roadster for everyday use. Performance isn't quite as good as competitors (BMW Z3/M Boxster) but the vario roof and comfort and convience equipment make it much more enjoyable to drive every day especially in the winter. Very very fun car. Haven't had a single mechanical problem with the car and only have to bring it in for tune ups/oil changes every 12000 miles or so.
