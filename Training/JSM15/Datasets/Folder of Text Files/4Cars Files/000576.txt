Bought the car with 28000 miles on odometer and now have over 111000 miles. Service has been excellent (the few times when I needed it) and the fit finish ride and amenities have been up to Lexus standards. I still get comments from others who ride with me that a car with that much mileage can be so quiet and ride so well.
