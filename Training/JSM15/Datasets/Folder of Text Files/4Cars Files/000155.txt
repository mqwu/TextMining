Ordered on sight and took 17 months to deliver. 2nd 430 cab in USA. After 20000 miles the car has really become special: great performance good looks and excellent handling.    It is sensitive to color: everyone takes the easy option...Mercedes silver but mine in Firemist Red attracts many spontaneous compliments.     Hard to figure what to replace it with: it is a great performance/practical bargain seating 4 people when needed.
