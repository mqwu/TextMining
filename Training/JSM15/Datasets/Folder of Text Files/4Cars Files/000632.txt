I LOVE this car. It is my first car and I will definenZy stick to MB's. Fortunately I have not had the bad problems as others have. I added a lot of extra's and it performs wonderfully. It is a head turner when a 16 yr old girl is driving it. This car has the smoothest ride. The personnel where I bought my MB at are very friendly and even call to check up on my car. I would recommend this car to anyone who really appreciates comfort quality and superior handling.
