$38789 includes tax. In summary I am very happy. I really like the Mark Levinson Audio / GPS system. The sound is remarkeable and the GPS is very useful and easy to use. Be sure you like that kind of thing and ask yourself if you get along with electronic toys/gadgets before spending the xtra $.    I'm confused on the transmission. When consciously trying to repeat the steps that others have described I have noticed unpredicteable behaviour but only when REALLY trying not through the normal course of my driving habits.    I am 33 and a pretty mellow driver using mostly for commutes. At times when I'm in a "Mood" I like to blow everyone away or beat a Semi when using the on-ramp. When you need xtra power it's there and it's adequate but it's not an excitement machine and I'm thankful I knew that before I bought.    One thing I'm a bit disgruntled about is the Vehicle Skid Control (VSC). There are times when I need to pull out into heavy traffic. If you need to make a sharp turn and cut across a couple of lanes the power cuts until the vehicle re-balances - Several times I've been a sitting duck with an unhappy motorist slamming their brakes and their horn behind me. I just went for my 5000 mile service and asked if they could adjust it or unhook it. Nope. It only happens during agressive moves so I'll live but just a word of warning - It seems to be more of a problem then a help.    That being said could it be that drivers are confusing a transmission problem with a VSC annoyance? I know that I thought I was going to bring in a lemon transmission until I realized it was actually the VSC kicking in when punching the gas and making a 90 degree turn simultaneously.
