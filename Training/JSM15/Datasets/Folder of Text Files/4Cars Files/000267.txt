This is my second GS 300 (1st 1998) and is the first time I have ever purchased the same car back to back. I trade every 24-36 months my car and my wifes car. I went to the 2001 model because I was told the transmission problems had been corrected. NOT TRUE ! Infact the 2001 model is WORSE. Not only is it slow to down shift it will hang up on the up shift (between 2nd and 3rd gears) then slam into gear. What really makes this unbearable is the fact that it doesnt't do it all the time and the service dept has dificulty with intermitten problems of such. What a disappointment.
