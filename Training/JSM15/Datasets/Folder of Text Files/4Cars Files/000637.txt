I think besides the tweaks of the first shipment of the 2001 model of the SLK 230 the car is the best buy for what your paying for. In terms of performance it may not be the fastest car on the road but you'll be surprised at what it can do when you push it a little. The interior is the best in my opinion out of all the roadsters available it's simple yet very distinctive and stylish everything comes together as one unique setup it is very user-friendly and nothing is in an awkward position. The blend of Style and Performance in both interior and exterior settings make the SLK 230 the roadster of my choose.
