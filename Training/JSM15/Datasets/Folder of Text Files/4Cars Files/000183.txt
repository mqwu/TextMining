WOW!! A fantastic car! I just replaced my 1998 M3 4-door with this beauty... A bright red 1998 540i Sport 6-speed. It is VERY fast (though you dont't FEEL the speed like you do with the M3). The handling is tight for a car of this size and it is a joy to drive. It is SOOO much more luxurious than the M3 especially with the navigation system and sport seats. The ride is a lot less harsh than the M3 but still fun. The only complaint I have is the "premium" stereo system (a $1500 option)... I LOVED the Harmon Kardont system of the M3. It had VERY tight bass clean highs excellent imaging and got very loud. But with the 540 system the bass is weak and the volume is low. I will add an Infinity Basslink to the system to beef it up a little.
