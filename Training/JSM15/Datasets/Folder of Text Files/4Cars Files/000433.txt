It has been a mixed experience. The car drives and performs extremly well for a four cylinder automobile. Exterior noise is hardly noticable and the fit and finish are top notch. There have been a few very expensive and frequent problems with this car. I would not recomend it to someone that wants a reliable car. Carefully weigh the prestige of a Mercedes against the surprising lack of integrity for such an expensive automobile.
