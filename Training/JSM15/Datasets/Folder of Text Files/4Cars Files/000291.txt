Good value for a Mercedes. Compromises are however apparent and annoying.Handles well and has suffcient power. Feels good to drive. Some quality problems from outset and predelivery service was not well dome at all.  All in all I would not buy this car again and would have sprung the extra bucks for a c240 or c 320
