I am very happy with this car. I have been debating and test driving all sorts of cars for the past 3 months and finally decided on the Z Type S. Everything from the LS 430 and new Q45 down to the Accord coupe and the CarZZ Z Type S had (and will have) the best value for the amount of car you get. The Q45 was my other choice but Infiniti is lacking in quality of their Nissan engines as of late. The Z Type S looks great drives great and has one of the best Navigation systems around. I highly recommend at least test driving this car to anyone interested in a luxury sport-sedan. Check out www.CarZZ-Z.com for a lot of useful information in their forums - a great help to those interested in this car.
