RecenZy purchased this vehicle. My initial impressions is that this is a true "sports sedan." It has elements of both a sports car and a sedan. It is quick fast maneuvers relatively well and goes where it is pointed. On the other hand it has sedan qualities such as a fairly good quiet ride comfort and has many of the desired amenities such as CD leather seats wood trim (could use a bit more) etc.
