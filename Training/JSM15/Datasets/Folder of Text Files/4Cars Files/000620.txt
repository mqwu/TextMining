The Legend Family from day one is a Credit to Honda. The Legends of the late 80's were fantastic cars the quality has amazing...so the later models are holding up one hell of a legacy started a few short years ago. That aside the '96 'series 3' Legend has an understated poise that is all class. Anyone who knows what they are talking about would not slag this car its a case of you either like it or you dontt. Me...I Loooooove this car. Why? because when I look at it I feel good when I drive it I feel good when my family is in it I know they are in a well built conmfortable SAFE car.If I had the money I may have bought a Lexus LS 400 but as time goes by I somehow feel that my next car will be a Honda Legend.
