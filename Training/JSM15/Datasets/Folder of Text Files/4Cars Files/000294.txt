This car was described to me as "once you drive BMW you dont't go back" by my former boss (who had owned BMW's for 30 years). After buying the 528i w/SP I must say he was right. This car handles glides speeds and everything great. The service is easy (oil change only required every 15k miles) and is a general pleasure to drive. I usually get bored with a car every 3 years or stop loving them after the first year. Not the 528 I actually look forward to the drive through the mountains every day!
