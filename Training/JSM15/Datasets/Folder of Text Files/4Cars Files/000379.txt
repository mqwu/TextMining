98 rl all opts. including navi...bought it with 42000 miles it now has 105k and has developed a slight trans problem...not happy.. I also have a 94 legend with 320000miles and never had any problems...anybody wanna buy this thing from me...my legends pic is on the wall at the acura dealer....i think i'll try a 98 ls4oo next..or wait for the new RL
