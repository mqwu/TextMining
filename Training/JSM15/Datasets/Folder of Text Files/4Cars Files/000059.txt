I have had this car for 3 months now and I love it. I think the best looking car out there in this price range. I looked at a lot of other cars and priced them with all the options on the Z and they where all more expensive by at least 2 grand. You get a great deal for your money. Everybody that has seen it loves it. The only problems I seem to have are. I get some water coming through the seal on the moonroof when it rains but it has a big metal tray that catches it all and lets it drain through the sides. Also after fueling up the car does not start on the first try sometimes. Does anyone else have this problems? Other then that the car is wonderful I would tell anyone looking for a near luxury car to buy it.
