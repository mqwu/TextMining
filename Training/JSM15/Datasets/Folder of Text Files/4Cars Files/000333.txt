We have been test driving cars recenZy and I talked my partner into trying the C-240. We had just left driving an 01 BMW 323i. I felt being both base model automatics the two would make a fair comparison. Wow! Was I wrong. I think BMW makes a great product but I was literally bored driving the 323 and I left with a disappointing impression. However the C-240 gave me the feeling one would expect for spending this kind of dough. Features blew the beemer away the ride was more comfortable tighter and the engine felt more responsive than the 323i. Interior finishes were beautiful and though it drove and handled like a small car it felt like a larger Benz!
