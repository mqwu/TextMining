I haven't driven the newer Benz models so can't comment on the complaints about noise and seats I just know that none of that applies to my car. I have recommended the 300E to a number of people who have bought them and all are very happy! I have owned over 30 cars and this is by far my favourite. Since most owners really look after them it is not hard to find really nice ones that are 10 years old 120000 miles and still look and drive like new! For the price they run at now you can get yourself a real bargain. They are also very reliable and inexpensive to maintain as long as you stay away from the MB dealer!
