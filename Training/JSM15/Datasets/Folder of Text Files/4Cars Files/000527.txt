Solid car with great acceleration even without the "S' package. Very quiet and seating very comfortable. Back seat passengers prefer the CarZZ over the Maxima. Great workmanship in and out. Dealership was great to deal with and saved money over Denver dealerships. Did a lot of homework before I decided on this car.
