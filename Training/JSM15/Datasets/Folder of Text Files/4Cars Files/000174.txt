For highway cruising around 100mph nothing beats this car. Heavy (almost 2 tons) and sluggish off the line with the automatic transmission but accelerates from 60-90mph easily. Fit and finish are incredible inside and out. Sound system lacking but I installed an after-market CD unit that sounded decent. Super road feel handles like a dream. Could handle (and needs) more than the 215hp that the 3.0L V8 provides. I would recommend the 540. Rear-wheel-drive is a blast on dry roads but care is needed in the rain and snow - needs snow tires in northern climates. '95 and later models come with traction control standard. Maintenance is pricey: ~$60 for an oil change. Brake pads and rotors needed frequent replacement. Front struts needed replacement at 70k miles. Check engine ID number on the web to make sure it is not prone to sulfur damage (well known on '94-'95 530's and 540's). Overall a very cool car. I would buy a used 5-series over a new Accord any day.
