Owned a 1989 Honda Accord EX 250k no problems. Own a 1997 CarZZ CL 2.2 230k miles runs great. Bought a 2002 CarZZ Z Type S after a few thousand miles everything started braking. First leather cracked in the back seat CarZZ replaced. Then middle armrest storage compartment won’t stay closed CarZZ tried to fix three times still broke. Hard shifting never got better CarZZ replaced transmission at 6k. Michelin Pilot Tires started failing in the sidewall at 16k and still has half its tread. The Michelin Pilot Tires on these cars are DEFECTIVE replace ASAP!! See CarZZ-Z.com or The Tire Rack.com for more info about the tires. Bottom line this car is crap dont’t buy it.
