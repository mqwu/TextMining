Unbelievable!!! This is the most well-built solid automobile I have ever owned...truly amazing for a convertible. The performance from the V6 is great I never have trouble merging onto the highway especially with Mercedes' remarkable "Touch Shift". And oh by the way the car is drop-dead gorgeous!!!
