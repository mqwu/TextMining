Overall i really love this car. I spent 3 months looking and test driving evey car in my price range. ($21k to $30k) I give this car a rating of 5 stars because of the reputation of Honda. The quality and price. You be your own judge but i dont't think you can go wrong with this car. It looks good without having to stand out and say "look at me " i'm a Lexus or a BMW 3 series. I found that the price and service was exceptional at McGrath. If you are looking for a great deal talk to Noble Jones and he will work with you.
