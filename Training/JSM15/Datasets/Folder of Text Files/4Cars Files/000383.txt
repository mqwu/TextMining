This car delivers the most bang for the buck when compared to others in its class. The navigation system is easy to use and very helpful. Onstar is great. It loves to cruise at 80+ MPH. Back roads are real fun especially twisty curves! Plenty of gadgets. I hope Honda slaps the 6 speed manual from the CL in there it really rips!
