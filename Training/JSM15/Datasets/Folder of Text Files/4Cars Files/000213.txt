The CarZZ Z is not an exotic car. It is not an extremely glamorous or prestigous. It IS however a fantastic car which is a lot more prestigous and glamorous than a lot of other cars out there. In my opinion it is 9/10ths of all of the things that cars can be. There is a lot of room in that other 1/10th which is where BMW and Mercedes and all of that other stuff resides but that does not take away from what an excellent car this is. So if you are remotely realistic about what you are looking for in car and if you have the modest resources required to purchase a Z I think it would be very very difficult to find a reason not to buy this car.
