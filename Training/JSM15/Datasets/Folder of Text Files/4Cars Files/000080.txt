This is the third Merc I bought in two years. Ml 320 SLK 230 The E is a great car sport is the best one to have and I love the ride gas mileage and comfort.   Dealer stinks. Both dealers in San Diego could care less how many cars you bought from them. They give the worst service ever. They even gave me a Sentra loner when I brought my SL 500 in!!!  Might switch to a real service company next time. They just dont't care. I even wrote to MBUSA and they didnt't care at all.
