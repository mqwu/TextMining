My fiance loves it my kids love it my anti-import US flag waving friend wants one. 5 stars all around. This is the vehicle for the non-minivan driving Mom's who want a roomy vehicle that doesnt't suggest Social Security. Monster trunk (enough room for my golf clubs and groceries)!!! Handles great acceleration to spare looks fantastic! CD changer is in trunk so no extra hands adding any music you didnt't ever want to hear and with the 6 disk changer it makes for music for an extended road trip. I bought mine used (definately the way to go) and feel confident that it will perform well for the next 100K miles. The very best thing about this car....cold winter mornings and heated seats....does it get better??
