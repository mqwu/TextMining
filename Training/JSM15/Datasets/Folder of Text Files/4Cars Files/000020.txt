Paid $43000 from a private seller who owns a car dealership and turns his cars over every 9-12 months. Car had 4700 miles on it. He bought it new from the local BMW dealer. List was $53000 when he bought it in February 2000 with every option available. Not sure why he came down to my offer from his listing at $48000 but I think it's because he and I hit it off since we're both car fanatics and I'm kind of young. This is my wife's car. She says that her stress level decreases by 50% every time she gets in it. She says its like slipping into a state of relaxing meditation when driving. As a sales executive who drives quite a bit that kind of feeling is very valuable to her. She had a Passat wagon before this and really liked it. On my urging we got this car and boy is she happy we did. She absolutely LOVES it. This car is a culmination of BMW's effort's over the past several decades. It amazes me how firm yet compliant the ride is(even with 235/45/17 tires). It drives superbly and loves to be pushed to its generous limit. It is whisper quiet inside when driving. The interior is gorgeous and in the wagon form has a good amount of cargo space. Everything is right where it should be and works flawlessly. The amount of thinking and features that have gone into this car will really blow your mind; truly a technological masterpiece. It is not perfect(see weaknesses) but it is so close to flawless that you appreciate its design and craftsmanship every time you drive it. This car is worth every penny. And if you have a lot of pennies and a penchant for speed opt for the 540i wagon.
