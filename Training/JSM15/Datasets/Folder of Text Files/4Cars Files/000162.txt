This is by far the best car I've had. We bought it in Venezuela and drove it there at a top speed of 140mph. That's pretty impressive for a car with only 210 hp. Imagine what it would do if it had a V8. I've owned this car since 1998 and had not a single problem with it. Only the usual routine maintenance.
