This is the FINEST luxury sport coupe in $42K – $75K category. You can’t beat its styling (inside and out) technology performance comfort and size. It is an amazing and satisfying experience to sit in and drive the CLK320 around. I will make any excuse for myself to drive it anywhere....I am a major car enthusiast...and I would always look at this car or others before passing by...now that I own a CLK - I dont't bother looking at other cars - at all. This style is classy and will never wear out – it is timeless (never outdated) like all Mercedes 2-doors 60s 70s 80s 90s SLs. My family friend has a 1991 Black Mercedes 560-SEC with over 100K and it looks and drives like a new car. I have always changed car every 2-3 years BUT I am definitely going to hold on to this car for long long time. RECOMMEND you get the extended warranty if you intend to get a CLK. Mercedes parts and service (just to look at a problem) is very expensive.
